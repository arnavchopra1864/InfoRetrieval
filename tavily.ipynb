       "  'content': 'Therefore, according to the ecosystem theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1986), the environment in which human beings live consists of four systems: microsystem, mesosystem, external system, and macrosystem, among which the microsystem refers to the way of activity, role patterns, and interpersonal relationship patterns of individuals in a particular environment; the way of behavior that promotes or inhibits individuals in that environment; and the interaction between individuals and that environment, which directly affects human cognitive ability, social development, and academic achievement; that is, the family environment and peer interactions are important microsystems of the individuals’ lives. In short, the present study introduced the mediating variable of peer interaction quality, which distinguished it from previous studies that commonly used learning anxiety, learning engagement, sense of autonomy, and parental involvement as mediating variables to build multiple or chained mediation models (Li et al., 2022; Qiu and Chai, 2022), greatly enriches the research on academic achievement, putting children’s academic achievement in the symbolic social living space where the family field and peer network are nested, to form a dynamic field to assist children’s social development and renewal, through peer interaction quality (important others) indirectly affect individual academic achievement, this provides clues and support for further exploring the influence of peer groups on students’ academic achievement.\\n According to Harris’ group socialization development theory (Harris, 1995): individuals acquire two independent behavioral systems inside and outside the family—the effect of family on children’s socialization is weakening, while the influence of peer groups in schools is increasing; for example, family education resources and parents’ SES have direct effects on adolescents’ math achievement and problem-solving ability (Long and Pang, 2016; Wang et al., 2021), and peer friendship quality and friends’ gain and loss predict adolescents’ learning engagement and academic achievement (Sebanc et al., 2016; Lessard and Juvonen, 2018)—getting along with friends who study well and live actively influences their initial study and helps in getting better grades. This study constructs an analytical framework of significant others embedded in the family environment and then combines the peer group effect (Winkler, 1975) and the identity control theory (Peter, 1991), which emphasize the differences from significant others, self, and other identity criteria, to explore the role of the quality of peer interactions and educational expectation gap of adolescents in the microsystem in the impact of the family environment on academic achievement. Third, the educational expectation gap not only moderates the path of the family environment directly influencing academic achievement but also moderates the first half path of the family environment influencing academic achievement through peer interaction quality; that is, the existence of a high educational expectation gap within the family will inhibit the positive effect of the family environment on adolescents’ academic achievement and peer interaction quality.\\n',\n",

The family environment is measured by parents and children’s reports, including family atmosphere, parent–child interaction, and family rules, to reveal the mediating effect of adolescents’ positive or negative peers between the family environment and academic achievement, and whether the gap between self- and parental educational expectation plays a moderating effect. This study uses the data of the China Education Panel Study (CEPS); the survey samples include 9,449 eighth-grade students (Mage = 13.55 years, SD = 0.70), establishing a multilevel moderated mediating effect model. The results showed (1) the family environment and peer interaction quality can positively predict adolescents’ academic achievement. (2) Using the KHB test, peer interaction quality plays a partial mediating role in the process of family environment positively affecting academic achievement, and the mediating ratio is 27.5%. (3) The educational expectation gap moderates the effect of the family environment on academic achievement and also on peer interaction quality. Therefore, from the perspective of environment and important others, to correctly grasp the academic achievement of junior high school students in the process of socialization, it is necessary to recognize that the family environment, peer interaction quality, and educational expectation gap play an important role.\\nIntroduction\\nThe salient characteristic feature of junior high school students’ academic achievement is the systematic study and participation in various comprehensive practical activities to improve their knowledge and skills in preparation for their future development, including the perception of both students’ self-competence (reading, spelling, language, arithmetic) and school performance (daily ability, writing ability, school satisfaction, calligraphy ability) (Chapman, 1988). Academic achievement in a narrow sense refers to students’ academic performance and course acceptance in school, while academic achievement in a broad sense refers to the knowledge, skills, and cognitive abilities that students acquire through certain teaching and training, both of which reflect the overall learning status and development of students (Sacco, 1997). As the main manifestation of adolescents’ achievements in receiving school education, it is the goal of adolescents’ development in the student period, which is related to the success of adolescents’ future career opportunities. Some scholars focus on adolescents’ cognitive ability and non-cognitive ability (Adams, 2021), prosocial behavior and problem behavior (Karmakar, 2017; Padilla et al., 2018), social development (Walters, 2013), and academic achievement (Zhang et al., 2020) issues; a study found that knowledgeable and successful families are conducive to children’s non-cognitive ability and social development, and a good family atmosphere and a parent–child relationship contribute to the development of physical and mental health (Marcenaro and Lopez, 2017; Obimakinde et al., 2019). Parents who communicate with their children, visit museums, or record daily activities can cultivate children’s information literacy, improve math and reading scores, and directly stimulate cognitive development (Sibley and Dearing, 2014; Choe, 2020). Moreover, family socioeconomic status (SES), related developmental resources (including parental support, expectations, and reading resources), and students’ individual reading motivation (including reading engagement and reading confidence) also affect adolescents’ learning outcomes (including academic achievement, school grades, and reading competence) (Mudrak et al., 2020).\\nWith the increase in communication time between adolescent students and their peers, they gradually break away from their families to participate in peer interaction; peers have become another major field affecting their development (Criss et al., 2016). The interpersonal relationship established by teenagers in the school field plays an essential role in their behavior development, cognitive ability, and academic performance, especially adolescents’ academic engagement or learning performance is influenced by friendship quality (Sebanc et al., 2016), friends’ gain and loss (Lessard and Juvonen, 2018), and peer personality (Golsteyn et al., 2021) factors in peer groups. Reviewing the research on the influence of family and important others on students’ achievement, there are two main points of view: On the one hand, according to American psychologist Harris’ group socialization development theory, parents and peers are the main objects for adolescents to realize social dependence, and they advocate that individual development (physical and mental development, and academic performance) is affected by the two ‘independent systems’ inside and outside the family (Harris, 1995). On the other hand, some scholars expressed that the influence of family members and peer groups on adolescents’ academic achievement was a kind of ‘mutual compensation’ (Fukuoka and Hashimoto, 1997). Although considerable research has involved single factors in the family environment (including socioeconomic status, parental autonomy support, and parental involvement in education) (Joussemet et al., 2005; Vasquez et al., 2016; Froiland and Worrell, 2017; Mudrak et al., 2020), important others, including teacher autonomy support, learning competition among students, and positive or negative learning behaviors of classmates, affect academic achievement (Diseth and Samdal, 2014; Li et al., 2022; Qiu and Chai, 2022). A small number of studies have also introduced emotion regulation, adaptive competencies, and sense of autonomy at the individual level as mediating variables, and these influencing processes are different due to different grades and genders (Liew et al., 2014; Qiu and Chai, 2022). However, from the beginning of junior high school, parents pay more attention to students’ academic achievement, and the time of students getting along with their peers in school is also significantly increased; much less is known about the role of peer relationships in the impact of family environment on academic achievement, and at the middle school stage, differences in educational expectations between parents and adolescents are constantly changing, which is particularly reflected in Chinese students. Therefore, this study is based on the academic achievement of Chinese adolescents; it is necessary to further study the internal relationship between the family environment and academic achievement by introducing the quality of peer interaction as a mediator and the factors of the gap between self- and parental educational expectations. This study seeks intervention measures from the factors of the quality of peer interaction and educational expectation gap, which will provide new ideas for improving the academic achievement of Chinese adolescents.\\nLiterature review and hypotheses\\nFamily environment and academic achievement\\nThe family environment is the sum of physical and psychological conditions, which carries the development of individual personality and behavior, among which family relations and parent–child interaction are its important components, affecting children’s academic achievement, character quality, and the expression of psychological modeling functions (Wilder, 2014; Krauss et al., 2020). According to the family systems theory, the family is composed of several subsystems, which are interconnected and mutually constrained to make the whole family function well, and the better the coordination of the family system, the better the psychological shape and academic performance of the members (Miller et al., 1985). Leung and Shek (2016) divided family functioning into five dimensions: family members’ relationship, communication and adaptation, conflict and harmony, parental attention, and parental control; in other words, the more harmonious family functioning is, the higher the self-rated family environment score is, emphasizing that family cohesion and harmonious parent–child relationship can promote adolescents’ physical and mental development. Findings of related scholars’ research on the impact of parental participation on children’s academic performance, development skills, and social behavior are given as follows (McCormick et al., 2013; Karmakar, 2017; Boonk et al., 2018): Parents’ educational level directly affects their children’s reading comprehension and math achievement; among them, the influence of mothers’ education level will be more lasting. Parents’ active participation in education has a significant effect on children’s academic achievement, educational achievement, and mental health, in particular parents’ support for the educational process, the cultivation of extracurricular interest, and the guidance of homework have a strong positive effect on the academic performance of adolescents (Wang and Sheikh, 2014; Benner et al., 2016). The family investment theory explains the effect of the family socioeconomic status on academic achievement (Duleep, 1998). Parents with high socioeconomic status will invest more in their children’s education (parents’ attention, support, and investment), and their children‘s academic achievement will be better (Mudrak et al., 2020; Poon, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). At the same time, perceived positive emotional expression in the family, daily communication, rule-making, and conflicting parental relationships have varying degrees of impact on adolescents’ behavioral tendencies (learning method and problem behavior) and academic achievement (social science, reading, language, and natural science scores) (Ghazarian and Buehler, 2010; Veas et al., 2019). It can be seen that previous studies mainly focus on the influence of factors from one aspect: family on children’s academic achievement. In addition, while promoting the smooth development of family education, recognizing the characteristics of the cognitive level and social competence of students at the junior high school stage, students’ academic achievements in a broad sense are affected by factors such as family atmosphere, parent–child interaction, and family rules. As Bronfenbrenner emphasized family as a microsystem that directly affects individual development (Bronfenbrenner, 1986), it serves as an educational ground for children’s symbolic values, sense of honor and disgrace, lifestyle, and various action strategies. It is further speculated that the score of the family environment generated by a family atmosphere, parent–child interaction, and family rules will have a direct effect on children’s academic achievement.\\nPeer interaction quality and academic achievement\\nStudents in junior high school travel between home and school, with alternating contact with parents and peers, and it is a process of gradual stabilization and continuous cognitive reproduction. In a diverse school, students tend to view themselves by the preferences or standards of their peer group, which subconsciously affects the acquisition of social values and the completion of their studies. In Coleman’s book “The Adolescent Society,” he points out that “teens suffering from rejection from peers is almost equivalent to being rejected by their parents” (Coleman, 1961). Combined with the peer group effect theory, peer group interaction conveys social norms, values, knowledge, and skills, and positive or negative peer relationships affect the learning attitude, self-expectation, and cognitive development of the participants (Winkler, 1975). Academic interaction between students in the classroom and the average score are all related to learning performance (math scores); forming a learning group can increase the possibility of cooperating to complete homework and enhance learning interest (Carman and Zhang, 2012). Comparing students in the classroom with their peers in the living environment and interaction with roommates in the informal environment have a stronger impact on academic performance (Jain and Kapoor, 2015; Fang and Wan, 2020). In essence, the structure of the peer network (quality, scale, heterogeneity, and cohesion) and students’ learning behavior (positive and negative) have an effect on students’ academic achievement (Berthelon et al., 2019; Qiu and Chai, 2022). For example, with diligent and dedicated classmates, the higher the quality of peer interaction (more positive peers and less negative peers in peer interaction), the better the results in subsequent learning (Golsteyn et al., 2021). In addition, in a better school, this peer effect will be amplified accordingly, that is, in a better school environment, students can interact with better peers, and the quality of making friends will be higher. They supervise each other in learning, and their academic performance will be better (Wang et al., 2021). Previous studies have not taken the quality of adolescents’ peer interaction as an important variable for research. Therefore, based on the quality of peer interaction in adolescents, that is, the “negative” or “positive” behavior of friends will affect their external performance and internal cognition, it is inferred that the more positive the quality of peer interaction, the more conducive to higher academic achievement.\\nMediating effect of peer interaction quality\\nThe social development of students in adolescence is crucial. As adolescents are gradually fleeing from getting along with their parents to making new friends, it is predicted that the effect of peers in the group on the social action or mentality structure of adolescents is increasing (Brown et al., 1993); peers play an important role in academic achievement. Parents and peers are the main objects for adolescents to rely on and complain to, and both of them play an important role in the process of individual socialization. Sociologists Hartup and Stevens (1997) proposed two different types of interpersonal relationships, vertical and horizontal, for children. Vertical relationship refers to the relationship between children and adults, such as the parent–child relationship and teacher–student relationship, which are complementary and provide children with a safety guarantee and a learning environment. Horizontal relationship refers to the peer relationship with the level of self-development, which has the function of providing physical and mental development and interaction for children. Therefore, students lack the support of parents and peer friendship and are prone to depression, resulting in academic waste, and it is prone to depression, resulting in academic abandonment. Research on the family environment (family social capital and parenting style), peer interaction, and adolescents’ academic achievement, there are two types of views: First, family and peer influence on adolescents is “independent.” According to Harris’ group socialization development theory (Harris, 1995): individuals acquire two independent behavioral systems inside and outside the family—the effect of family on children’s socialization is weakening, while the influence of peer groups in schools is increasing; for example, family education resources and parents’ SES have direct effects on adolescents’ math achievement and problem-solving ability (Long and Pang, 2016; Wang et al., 2021), and peer friendship quality and friends’ gain and loss predict adolescents’ learning engagement and academic achievement (Sebanc et al., 2016; Lessard and Juvonen, 2018)—getting along with friends who study well and live actively influences their initial study and helps in getting better grades. Second, the influence of peers and family on adolescents is a “complementary” view (Fukuoka and Hashimoto, 1997), that is, peer interaction transmits the effect of family environment on adolescents’ academic performance, compared with childhood, at the adolescent stage, parent education and parent-child interaction no longer meet their needs, but gradually extend to seeking support or help among peers, and peer interaction and family environment together influence adolescents’ growth. The family environment (parenting style, behavior supervision, and emotional intervention) plays a decisive role in the quality of peer interaction among adolescents; for example, parents supervise their children’s home time, places to go out, friend interactions, and homework completion, which would increase children’s exposure to peers with positive learning behaviors (Deutsch et al., 2012; DeAnna, 2016), which indicates that parent–child communication and parental educational involvement influence children’s interpersonal interactions. At the same time, the peer network structure, friend quality, and personality orientation also affect students’ academic achievement (Berthelon et al., 2019; Golsteyn et al., 2021). Based on the available research, a more superior family environment may have a positive effect on students’ academic achievement by increasing their peer interaction quality.\\nModerating effect of educational expectation gap\\nEducational expectation is based on one’s cognitive ability, realistic conditions, and parents’ expectation of children or adolescents’ academic achievements in their future (Wang and Benner, 2014). It belongs to a category of social cognition, including the sender and the expected. When the two are the same individual, it is called “self-education expectation,” and when the expectation is sender by parents and the expectation is expected by children, it is called “parental education expectation” (Wang and Benner, 2014; Castro et al., 2015). The identity control theory points out (Peter, 1991) that parental education expectation is seen as a reflective evaluation of important others, and it is an important type of social environment information input; self-education expectation is regarded as an individual’s identification standard of the current social role. When the two are inconsistent, individuals will have a sense of stress, which even leads to psychological distress and affects development, and is closely related to individual intrinsic motivation (Moe, 2016). When parents’ educational expectation is moderate, it is conducive to the cultivation of children’s social value and the shaping of healthy personality, while when parents’ expectation is much higher than their children’s self-expectation, it will make the goal impossible to achieve, resulting in tense parent–child relationship and weariness of learning, which will harm academic achievement (Marcenaro and Lopez, 2017; Lv et al., 2018). On the one hand, children’s reading and math scores are related to net household assets; the higher the SES of parents, the higher the educational expectation for their children, providing a quality educational environment to ensure that children have good supportive resources. Parents’ higher education expectation or lower self-education expectation moderates this effect (Zhan, 2006; Zhang et al., 2011). The higher parental expectation and short-term educational expectation in junior high school have a lasting positive effect on children’s academic performance (school achievement, test scores, and academic completion) (Yamamoto and Holloway, 2010). In fact, in the study of parents’ expectations and their children’s academic achievement (reading achievement and academic achievement), parents’ expectation of their children’s study is consistent with their expectation of self-education, which can better improve their social cognitive ability (Phillipson and Phillipson, 2012; John and Bierman, 2017). It shows that the educational expectation gap between children and parents will moderate the impact of the family environment on academic achievement.\\nOn the other hand, according to the analysis of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) data, children grow up under the emotional education of their parents and have a better experience of happiness, making friends with active companions, less likely to fight, smoke, or take drugs (Chan and Koo, 2011). In the study of 497 Dutch adolescents (13 years) from exposure to negative peers to crime, parents’ excessive restrictions on their children’s friends hinders their ability to develop autonomously and increases the risk of having bad peers (Keijsers et al., 2012). Parents with higher SES have a higher expectation for their children, which accordingly enlarges the negative effects of problem peers. This process reflects that parents’ expectations, or parenting styles moderate the impact of family socioeconomic status on deviant peers (Forgatch et al., 2016; Valdivia and Castello, 2020). Reviewing the research on the differences between children’s self-education expectation and perceived parents’ educational expectation, parents’ educational expectation is not always consistent with that of their offspring; both have different perceptions of future educational goals, which is universal (Rutherford, 2015). When there is a large gap between parents’ educational expectation and self-educational expectation, the educational expectation gap affects the quality, scale, and structure of children’s peer relationship. Based on this, this study introduces the concept of the “educational expectation gap,” speculating that the intergenerational educational expectation gap plays a moderating role between the family environment, peer interaction quality, and academic achievement.\\nPresent study and hypotheses\\nPrevious studies reported the relationship between the family environment and academic achievement (Benner et al., 2016; Boonk et al., 2018; Veas et al., 2019; Mudrak et al., 2020) and introduced the factors of parental education expectation, self-education expectation, and peer interaction (Phillipson and Phillipson, 2012; Sebanc et al., 2016; Lessard and Juvonen, 2018; Qiu and Chai, 2022). Among them, most studies regard parental education expectation and self-education expectation as separate variables to examine the effect of the family environment on academic achievement (Marcenaro and Lopez, 2017; Lv et al., 2018), and some scholars also studied the influence of the peer network structure, friendship quality, and personality orientation on adolescents’ academic achievement (Berthelon et al., 2019; Golsteyn et al., 2021). Parents supervise their children’s home time, places to go out, friend interactions, and homework completion, which would increase children’s exposure to peers with positive learning behaviors, which may have a positive impact on children’s academic achievement (Deutsch et al., 2012; DeAnna, 2016). However, few studies have emphasized the impact of the family environment and peer interaction quality on adolescents’ academic achievement and the role of the gap between parents’ and children’s educational expectations in this process, in particular the study of adolescents who are in the middle school stage and have high expectations for parental education and more contacts with peers. Therefore, according to the ecosystem theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1986), the environment in which human beings live consists of four systems: microsystem, mesosystem, external system, and macrosystem, among which the microsystem refers to the way of activity, role patterns, and interpersonal relationship patterns of individuals in a particular environment; the way of behavior that promotes or inhibits individuals in that environment; and the interaction between individuals and that environment, which directly affects human cognitive ability, social development, and academic achievement; that is, the family environment and peer interactions are important microsystems of the individuals’ lives. This study constructs an analytical framework of significant others embedded in the family environment and then combines the peer group effect (Winkler, 1975) and the identity control theory (Peter, 1991), which emphasize the differences from significant others, self, and other identity criteria, to explore the role of the quality of peer interactions and educational expectation gap of adolescents in the microsystem in the impact of the family environment on academic achievement. Based on available research results, this study proposed the following hypotheses and a moderated mediation model (see Figure 1).\\nModerated mediation model.\\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Family environment will have a direct effect on adolescents’ academic achievement.\\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Peer interaction quality will have a direct effect on adolescents’ academic achievement.\\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Peer interaction quality will play a mediating role between family environment and adolescents’ academic achievement.\\nHypothesis 4a (H4a): Educational expectation gap will moderate the effect of family environment on adolescents’ academic achievement.\\nHypothesis 4b (H4b): Educational expectation gap will moderate the effect of family environment and adolescents’ peer interaction quality.\\nMaterials and methods\\nResearch data\\nThe data for this study are from the nationally representative “China Education Panel Study” (CEPS) implemented by the China Survey and Data Center of the Renmin University of China. The survey involves students, schools, and districts of multilevel characteristic variables, using a stratified multistage, probability, and scale proportional (PPS) sampling method. A total of 438 classes were randomly selected from 112 schools of 28 county-level units, and all the students in the selected class were investigated, in the baseline survey in 2015. A total of 10,279 junior middle school seventh-grade students were present after data merging and missing values filling, and 9,449 eighth-grade students successfully tracked in the 2016 follow-up survey are used as effective samples.\\nVariables and measurements\\nCombining the narrow and broad definitions of academic achievement (Sacco, 1997), it refers to students’ academic performance and course acceptance at school, as well as knowledge, skills, and cognitive abilities acquired through certain teaching and training. The academic achievement of this study is measured by three indicators: students’ cognitive ability, test scores, and the acceptance ability of the main courses (Chinese, Math, and English). The project team designed a cognitive ability scale, which includes 22 items in three dimensions of language, graphics, and computing and logic, to measure students’ logical thinking and problem-solving ability. Each student’s score is used to measure cognitive ability. Referring to the academic achievement index (Li et al., 2022), test scores are the total scores of students’ Chinese, math, and English midterm examinations. The ability to accept the main course is measured by asking students whether “is it hard to learn at present?” in the three courses of Chinese, math, and English, and each question corresponds to four options, with 1 representing “special effort” and 4 representing “no effort.” The scores of the three question items were summed to generate a continuous variable with a value range of 3–12. The higher the score, the easier the learning process experience. Based on the fact that academic achievement in this study includes three dimensions of cognition, objectivity, and subjectivity; the common factors of these three dimensions are extracted through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The first factor is 1.63, and the second factor is 0.75 (1.63/0.75 = 2.17, 2.17 < 3), indicating that the constructed academic achievement is multidimensional. At the same time, considering that in the item response theory (IRT) model, the respondents’ response to the project (the probability of right answer) and their potential (psychological traits) have a certain connection and need to meet the measurement is a one-dimensional premise assumption (Lord and Wingersky, 1984; Reise et al., 1993). Therefore, the method of dimension reduction of academic achievement by the EFA test is better. The results show that the cumulative variance contribution rate is 80.2%, the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value is 0.714, and the Bartlett sphericity test is significant (p < 0.05), and the constructed academic achievement index has less information loss and strong representativeness.\\nBased on the Family Environment Scale (Oliver et al., 1988), Family Environment Scale-Chinese Version is revised (Ni et al., 2021), including intimacy, emotional expression, contradiction, independence, success, culture, entertainment, morality, organization, and control; Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of each dimension is between 0.68 and 0.87. Combining with the Effective Pre-school and Primary Education project (EPPE), the scale includes parents’ attitudes and interaction with parents (Eisenstadt, 2010). In this study, 29 items of the family atmosphere (seven items), parent–child interaction (eleven items), and family rules (eleven items) in CEPS were selected to evaluate adolescents’ family environment, using a three-point Likert scale; the higher the total score, the better the family environment, and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the questionnaire is 0.84.\\nUsing the Reference Friendship Quality Scale (FQS) (Bukowski et al., 1994) and peer relationship measurement (Martina et al., 2020), according to the items included in CEPS, positive peer interaction among students “friends with good grades, hard work, and want to go to college” (three items), and negative peer interaction “absence of class, violation of school discipline, fighting, smoking and drinking, Internet cafes or game hall, early love, dropout” negative peer interaction (seven items) were investigated. All were scored by a three-point Likert scale. Comparing the score of positive peer interaction with the total score of positive and negative peer interaction, the value is a continuous variable; the larger the value, the more positive the peer interaction and the higher the peer quality. We conduct confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on 10 items; the average variance extracted (AVE) of each second-order factor is between 0.570 and 0.594, which is greater than 0.50, and the composite reliability (CR) is between 0.798 and 0.910, which is greater than 0.70, indicating that the aggregation validity is high. The results of the model showed that Chisq = 1206.813, df = 34, Chisq/df = 35.494, RMSEA = 0.060, RMR = 0.006, GFI = 0.974, CFI = 0.976, TLI = 0.968, indicating that the results of CFA had good fitting indicators, and the resulting peer interaction quality had good stability and fitting degree.\\nBased on the measurement of educational expectation (Rutherford, 2015; Marcenaro and Lopez, 2017), since the general educational expectation of Chinese parents for their children is whether or not they can get into college, in this study, parental education expectation was measured by the parental question “what degree do you want your child to read?”; similarly, students’ self-education expectation was measured by the student question “what degree do you want yourself to read?.” Among the operationalized variables, parental education expectation was divided into two groups: parents want their children to go to college and not to have to go to college. Similarly, students’ self-education expectations were divided into two groups: students who wanted and did not want to get themselves into college. The difference between the former and the latter is used to generate the “educational expectation gap” variable; that is, parental education expectation below or equal to students’ self-expectation is labeled “low educational expectation,” and parental education expectation above students’ self-expectation is labeled “high educational expectation.” The educational expectation gap was converted into a dichotomous variable with a value of 0 or 1.\\nAnalytical strategy\\nConsidering the heterogeneity between different schools and relatively high homogeneity among students in the same school, we established a multilevel linear model to explore the relationship between adolescents’ academic achievement at the individual and school levels. We used Stata 15.1 software to transform the academic achievement (time 1 and time 2) into the range of 0∼100 by range normalization (Hoffman, 2015; Maslowsky et al., 2015), that is, X’ = (X–Xmin)/(Xmax–Xmin) × 100; eliminate the influence of variation dimension and variation range; and ensure that the estimated results can be compared under the same dimension: (1) Descriptive statistical results were presented, and 4,481 female students (47.4%) and 4,968 male students (52.6%) were included in the follow-up survey. The age ranged from 12 to 18 years old, Mage = 13.55 years, SD = 0.70. There were 4,214 singleton students (44.6%) and 5,235 non-singleton students (55.4%). Table 1. (2) The differences in the academic achievement of students with different family backgrounds and the correlation test of core variables were analyzed. (3) The influence of family environment and peer interaction quality in the base period survey (time 1) on the academic achievement tracked (time 2), and the role of educational expectation gap in it were also analyzed; if p < 0.05, regression is considered to be important. Academic achievement is measured by a lag phase of data, which can solve the endogenous problem and predict current academic achievement from the past environment or other factors. It has a clearer causal logic relationship (Hoffman, 2015). The main study steps are as follows: First, a null model M0 with a random intercept but no explanatory variable is estimated to explore the total difference in academic achievement, which is decomposed into the difference between students and schools, and establish a school fixed effect model (Bryk and Raudenbush, 1987). Second, model M1 tests the effect of the family environment. Third, model M2 tests explain differences in the peer interaction quality on academic achievement. Fourth, model M3 also adds the effects of the family environment and peer interaction quality prediction on academic achievement. Model M4 takes the sum of base period data and tracking data (academic achievement) as the dependent variable to test the robustness of the model. Finally, models M5, M6, and M7 are constructed to test whether peer interaction quality plays a mediating role between the family environment and academic achievement. The mediating effect test usually includes the Sobel (1982) test and stepwise method (Baron and Kenny, 1986); these two methods require the assumption that the product term variables formed by the two methods have normal distribution, resulting in low test power on the test coefficient items in turn. In smaller samples, the bias-corrected bootstrap often reduces the error more than other methods (Hayes and Scharkow, 2013). This study explores the effect of the family environment on academic achievement through mediating variables and uses KHB method to test the effect and size of mediation (Kohler et al., 2011); the method can be any of Regress, Logit, Ologit, Probit, Oprobit, Cloglog, Slogit, Scobit, Rologit, Clogit, Mlogit, Xtlogit, or Xtprobit, and it can be extended to other models. At the same time, we also used the bootstrap repeated test results to further verify that peer interaction quality does play a mediating role. The models M5^ and M6^ are used to verify the moderating effect of the educational expectation gap; if the product of predictor (family environment) and moderator (educational expectation gap) has a significant effect on outcome variables (academic achievement and peer interaction quality) (Baron and Kenny, 1986), it proves that the moderating variable plays a moderating role.\\nTABLE 1\\nVariables of descriptive statistical results.\\nBrackets as the reference group. Academic achievement standardized to 0∼100.\\nResults\\nClass differences, correlation, and fixed effect test of adolescents’ academic achievement\\nAnalyzing the differences in adolescent academic achievement across family backgrounds (see Figure 2). Adolescents with high education-level parents, party membership, and household registration in urban areas have good academic achievements. In addition, in order to reveal the factors affecting adolescents’ academic achievement accurately, we tested the correlation of core variables. Academic achievement was positively correlated with the family environment (r = 0.31, p < 0.05) and peer interaction quality (r = 0.39, p < 0.05), and the family environment was positively correlated with peer interaction quality (r = 0.28, p < 0.05). The educational expectation gap was negatively correlated with academic achievement (r = −0.15, p < 0.05), family environment (r = −0.07, p < 0.05), and peer interaction quality (r = −0.13, p < 0.05). At the same time, we selected 20 schools as a small sample, aiming at determining the main effect of each school’s adolescents’ family environment on academic achievement, and measured the different intercepts and slopes in different schools, which confirmed the need to build a fixed effect model (see Figure 3).\\nDifferences in adolescents’ academic achievement in different households.\\nFixed effect test of different school academic achievements.\\nMultilevel regression estimation of adolescents’ academic achievement\\nAs given in Table 2, adolescent academic achievement was considered as the dependent variable and M0 as a null model, and the overall differences in academic achievement are broken down into differences between students and schools. The ICC between groups was 0.319, which shows that it is very suitable to use a multilevel regression model to control for heterogeneity factors between schools and to better estimate the net effect of family and peer-level factors on academic achievement. After M1 controls variables at the individual and school levels, the family environment has a positive impact on academic achievement (β = 0.26, p < 0.001); hence, H1 is verified. Similarly, in M2, peer interaction quality has a positive effect on academic achievement (β = 0.47, p < 0.001), that is, for every one-unit increase in the quality of peer interaction, adolescents’ academic achievement significantly increases by 47.0%; hence, H2 is verified. In M3, the family environment and peer interaction quality are added to confirm that the coefficients of the multilevel nested model have good stability, and it was found that the coefficient of family environment variables decreased from 26.0% to 19.0% after joining peer interaction quality, and it was still significant. It is necessary to further test the internal mechanism of the family environment and peer interaction quality affecting academic achievement. In M4, the mean value of the dependent variable (academic achievement) of the baseline survey and the follow-up survey is calculated. We built a full model, and the results are consistent with the influence coefficients in M3, showing that the whole research has good robustness.\\nTABLE 2\\nMultilevel regression estimation results of adolescents’ academic achievement.\\n+p < 0.1, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\\nFamily environment, peer interaction quality, and academic achievement: Moderated mediation model test\\nTable 3, in M5, academic achievement as the dependent variable, the total effect of the family environment on academic achievement is 26.0%. In M6, with peer interaction quality as the dependent variable, the effect of family environment on peer interaction quality is 17.0%. In M7, with academic achievement as the dependent variable, the direct effect of adolescents’ family environment on academic achievement is 22.0%, which was 4.0% lower than the total effect (0.26–0.22 = 0.04), and the peer interaction quality has a significant impact on academic achievement (β = 0.42, p < 0.001). It shows that peer interaction quality transmits the influence of the family environment on adolescents’ academic achievement, especially the KHB test shows that peer interaction quality plays a partial mediating role in the process of the family environment affecting academic achievement, and the mediating ratio is 27.5%; hence, H3 is verified. Meanwhile, in M5^, the interaction between the family environment and educational expectation gap has a negative significant effect on academic achievement (β = −0.24, p < 0.001), and peer interaction quality moderates the effect of the family environment on adolescents’ academic achievement; hence, H4a is verified. In M6^, the interaction between the family environment and educational expectation gap had a negative effect on peer interaction quality (β = −0.07, p < 0.01), and peer interaction quality moderates the effect of family environment on peer interaction quality of adolescents; hence, H4b is verified. It shows that in the case of different educational expectations, the influence of the family environment on adolescents’ academic achievement and peer interaction quality is different; compared with the high-education expectation group, the influence of the family environment on adolescents’ academic achievement (β = −0.24, p < 0.001) and peer interaction quality (β = −0.07, p < 0.01) was weaker than that of the low-education expectation group.\\nTABLE 3\\nPeer interaction quality and educational expectation gap: Moderated mediation effect test.\\n+p < 0.1, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\\nAccording to the estimation results of the models in Tables 2, \\u200b,3,3, we further draw the path diagram of the moderated mediation model. Figure 4 shows that the family environment and peer interaction quality have a significant positive effect on adolescents’ academic achievement of 0.26 and 0.47, respectively, which clearly verifies H1 and H2. Figure 5 shows the coefficients of the three paths of family environment → peer interaction quality, peer interaction quality → academic achievement, and family environment → academic achievement are 0.17, 0.42, and 0.22; it is measured that peer interaction quality transmits the effect of the family environment on adolescents’ academic achievement by 27.5% [(0.17 × 0.42)/0.26 = 0.275]. At the same time, bootstrap was used for the mediating test (Hayes and Scharkow, 2013), and the mediating effect of peer interaction quality was tested by repeated sampling for 1000 times using the bootstrap method; the 95% confidence interval (CI) was [0.163, 0.196], which again verified that peer interaction quality plays a mediating role before family environment and academic achievement; hence, it supports H3. Figure 6 shows that the effect of interaction between the family environment and peer interaction quality on academic achievement is −0.24, and the effect of interaction between the family environment and educational expectation gap on peer interaction quality is −0.07, both of which indicate that the higher educational expectation gap will put adolescents’ academic achievement and peer interaction quality at a disadvantage, thus verifying H4a and H4b.\\nModerated mediation model (H1 + H2). ***p < 0.001.\\nModerated mediation model (H3). ***p < 0.001.\\nModerated mediation model (H4a + H4b). **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\\nDiscussion\\nStudents in the junior middle school stage are in puberty where their physical and mental development are not yet mature and are easily affected by important others and external environmental factors. Therefore, this study explores the relationship among the family environment, peer interaction quality, educational expectation gap, and adolescents’ academic achievement and further promotes the development of relevant theories. It also has important practical significance to improve adolescents’ academic achievement. On the one hand, this study is based on the ecosystem theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1986), peer group effect theory (Winkler, 1975), and identity control theory (Peter, 1991). Placing adolescents’ academic achievement in a system influenced by the interaction of individual and environment, interactions between peer groups convey social norms and values, as well as parental education expectation is regarded as a reflective evaluation of important others, and there are differences between it and self-education expectation as the standard of individual’s current role orientation. Practical combined with theory, an analytical framework was constructed to study the academic achievement of adolescents, and it was verified that family environment and peer interaction quality play a positive role in academic achievement, which is basically consistent with previous research results (Carman and Zhang, 2012; Boonk et al., 2018; Berthelon et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020), greatly expanded the Ecosystem Theory embedded in micro theory (Peer Group Effect, Identity Control) to study the academic achievement of adolescents.\\nOn the other hand, this study also has important practical significance. It makes us understand the mediating role of peer interaction quality (from the influence of important others) between the family environment and academic achievement and enriches the research on the influence of the family environment and important others on academic achievement. It is necessary to pay attention to the influence of the family environment on children’s academic achievement in multiple ways, to create an active family atmosphere, frequent parent–child interaction, and strict family rules and to dynamically understand the quality of children’s peers. At the same time, the influence of peer interaction quality on academic achievement is a double-edged sword. When parents’ education expectation is higher than self-education expectation, it will not only negatively affect adolescents’ academic achievement but also lead to more negative peers; however, the gap between parents’ education expectation and self-education expectation is moderate, which plays a positive role in adolescents’ academic achievement (Zhang et al., 2011; Marcenaro and Lopez, 2017). Therefore, we call on all sectors of society to pay attention to the moderate expectations of parents in the family for their children’s future roles or achievements and avoid pressure caused by too high or too low expectations. This plays an important role in children making positive peers and friends and achieving good academic achievements.\\nThe mediating effect of peer interaction quality between family environment and academic achievement\\nThe family environment is the external support resource to ensure adolescents’ academic success and the premise of various related factors in the teaching process. It is the initial field of children’s socialization and the carrier of shaping good academic achievements. Through the mediating effect test, the peer interaction quality of adolescents conveys the partial effect of the family environment on academic achievement. The empirical study dialogs with Harris’ group socialization theory and further verifies that peer interaction quality is the link between the family environment and children’s academic achievement (Fukuoka and Hashimoto, 1997). The family environment directly affects the individual’s academic achievement, which is consistent with the results of studies indicating that family socioeconomic status, parents’ attention, support, and investment in children’s education affect their academic performance (Poon, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). At the same time, the family function also affects group selection and friend composition in individual peer interaction. Interaction with peers exerts a subtle influence on children’s academic achievement and personality shaping, which is consistent with previous studies (Deutsch et al., 2012; DeAnna, 2016). In short, the present study introduced the mediating variable of peer interaction quality, which distinguished it from previous studies that commonly used learning anxiety, learning engagement, sense of autonomy, and parental involvement as mediating variables to build multiple or chained mediation models (Li et al., 2022; Qiu and Chai, 2022), greatly enriches the research on academic achievement, putting children’s academic achievement in the symbolic social living space where the family field and peer network are nested, to form a dynamic field to assist children’s social development and renewal, through peer interaction quality (important others) indirectly affect individual academic achievement, this provides clues and support for further exploring the influence of peer groups on students’ academic achievement.\\nThe moderating effect of educational expectation gap between family environment, academic achievement, and peer interaction quality\\nWe propose a moderated mediation model based on relevant theories, by examining the role of the educational expectation gap within the family. Parents’ high educational expectations have a negative moderating effect on children’s academic achievement. That is, the model of ‘mother’s actual education wish >self-education wish’ negatively predicts academic performance, while the model of “mother’s actual education wish <self-education wish” positively predicts academic performance (Wang and Benner, 2014). Differences in educational expectations similar to those between parents and children will hinder children’s reading, mathematics, language, and grade point average (GPA) (Rutherford, 2015; Marcenaro and Lopez, 2017). The difference in educational expectations between parents and children is the product of the normal development process of an individual, and it is related to the pressure within the family (family function disintegration, poor family interaction, and poor family cohesion) that can make family members inconsistent (Minuchin, 1985). It may also be the reason for the correlation between the intrinsic motivation of adolescents (including enthusiasm, pleasure, interest, enjoyment, and curiosity) and self-expectation (Moe, 2016). This provides empirical support for the self-discrepancy theory, which points out that there are differences in real self, ideal self, and ought-to self, resulting in an unsatisfactory state, which may lead to depression and affect individual academic development (Higgins, 1987). At the same time, the educational expectation gap moderates the effect of family environment on peer interaction quality, and it is consistent with previous studies which show that parents with low behavior control or high psychological supervision increase children’s chances of contacting poor peers. Peer transmission affects adolescents’ behavior development (Forgatch et al., 2016; Valdivia and Castello, 2020). Based on this, for adolescents with a better family environment, a moderate educational expectation of parents and children can protect peer interaction quality and academic achievement, while excessive educational expectation gap between parents and children will increase the psychological burden of adolescents and have a negative impact on academic achievement. It expands the research of the educational expectation difference between parents and children in the field of individual academic achievement, taking into account the objective environmental factors of the family. We should also include the potential role of important others (parental expectations and peer interaction) in a diversified environment.\\nLimitations and future research directions\\nThis study has some limitations and needs to be improved in future research: First, based on the theoretical basis, this work longitudinally studies the influence mechanism of the family environment on academic achievement, which provides empirical support for relevant theoretical viewpoints. However, the self-report in the tracking data may be biased, and experimental research will be used in the next step to obtain more reliable conclusions. Second, the data used are not designed to investigate students’ academic achievements. Future research will design a special questionnaire to collect data to ensure more accurate data information so as to monitor students’ academic development.\\nIn conclusion, this study preliminarily verifies that peer interaction quality plays an intermediary role between the family environment and academic achievement. The educational expectation gap between parents and self within the family moderated the pathways of family environment → peer interaction quality (the first half path), and family environment → academic achievement (the direct path). Using the national-level survey data, rather than limited to a specific area of a small sample survey, a multi-country comparative study is planned for the next step. And further follow-up the factors of achievement motivation, emotional engagement and enthusiasm level of adolescents’ individual learning, the Structural Equation Model (SEM) or Chain Multi-mediary Model will be established to better capture adolescents’ academic achievement jointly from two dimensions: family microsystem and important others (peer interaction quality), enrich and extend the views of relevant theories, to provide practical enlightenment for a more scientific grasp of adolescents’ academic achievement.\\nConclusion\\nThis study uses longitudinal data from a survey of Chinese adolescents. So far, two waves of data have been collected. The research objects were 9,449 eighth-grade students who were successfully tracked, to explore the relationship between adolescents’ family environment (baseline survey) and academic achievement (follow-up survey), and pay special attention to the mediating effect of peer interaction quality between them, and the moderating effect of the gap between self- and parental educational expectations in this process. The results showed that first, the family environment and peer interaction quality can positively predict students’ academic achievement. Second, peer communication quality of adolescents plays a partial mediating role in the process of the family environment positively affecting academic achievement, with a mediating ratio of 27.5%. Third, the educational expectation gap not only moderates the path of the family environment directly influencing academic achievement but also moderates the first half path of the family environment influencing academic achievement through peer interaction quality; that is, the existence of a high educational expectation gap within the family will inhibit the positive effect of the family environment on adolescents’ academic achievement and peer interaction quality.\\nData availability statement\\nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study, this original data can be found here: http://ceps.ruc.edu.cn.\\nEthics statement\\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Renmin University of China.

One frequent explanation of these differences is disproportionate child-related responsibilities for women. However, changing social dynamics around parenting has led to fathers taking an increasingly active role in parenting. This demands a more nuanced approach to understanding the relationship between parenting and productivity for both men and women. To gain insight into associations between parent roles, partner type, research productivity, and research impact, we conducted a global survey that targeted 1.5 million active scientists; we received viable responses from 10,445 parents (<â€‰1% response rate), thus providing a basis for exploratory analyses that shed light on associations between parenting models and research outcomes, across men and women. Results suggest that the gendered effect observed in production may be related by differential engagement in parenting: men who serve in lead roles suffer similar penalties for parenting engagement, but women are more likely to serve in lead roles and to be more engaged across time and tasks, therefore suffering a higher penalty. Taking a period of parental leave is associated with higher levels of productivity; however, the productivity advantage dissipates after six months for the US-sample, and at 12-months for the non-US sample. These results suggest that parental engagement is a more powerful variable to explain gender differences in academic productivity than the mere existence of children, and that policies should factor these labor differentials into account.\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nRETRACTED ARTICLE: The association between early career informal mentorship in academic collaborations and junior author performance\\nBedoor AlShebli, Kinga Makovi & Talal Rahwan\\nBias against parents in science hits women harder\\nFernanda Staniscuaski, Arthur V. Machado, â€¦ Leticia de Oliveira\\nUnequal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on researchers: evidence from Chile and Colombia\\nMagdalena Gil, Constanza Hurtado-Acuna, â€¦ Alejandra Caqueo-UrÃ\\xadzar\\nIntroduction\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic placed the productivity cost of parenting into sharp relief. Studies provide evidence of a decrease in women first-authorship on preprints1,2, papers1, and funding applications3, and lower participation in academic citizenship activities4 than men. Consistent with previous research on gender disparities in science1,2, reasons for this inequity reference womenâ€™s engagement in household responsibilities4,5 and an increase of caregiving activities during COVID-19 related lockdowns, both for academics6 and non-academics7,8. Similar effects have been noted within journals of many disciplines including science studies9,10,11; gender studies12; economics13,14; sociology15 and higher education studies16,17. Regardless of the field, the prevailing argument is simple: childcare and homeschooling for extended periods of time were overwhelmingly fulfilled by women18,19, thereby decreasing their engagement in professional responsibilities.\\nScientific inequities, however, predate the pandemic. Decades of work on gender in science have shown that, on average, women publish fewer articles20,21,22 and receive fewer citations for their work23, even when publishing in journals with higher Impact Factors3,24. Such disparities in scientific productivity and performance are considered an artifact of wider structural inequalities within the science system. Domestic responsibilities associated with parenting have been heralded as an explanation for these differences25; yet, research on the relationship between parenting and scientific productivity have produced mixed results. Studies have found that women with children face a productivity penalty compared to men with children and women without children26,27,28. Other studies have suggested no association between production and family obligations29 or an increase in productivity immediately after birth5,26. The latter may be an artifact of publication lags and the pressures of an academic environment: demonstrating that women accelerate their productivity directly before birth, which manifests after.\\nMany of the explanations belie the intricacies of modern parenting5 and previous studies of gender and scientific productivity fail to fully capture this complexity. Women have entered the workforce at higher rates, changing the norm to a dual-labor household30,31. In addition, the concept of fatherhood has also changed with fathers taking an increasingly central role in child-rearing32, particularly during the pandemic33,34. Studies also suggest attrition from STEM after the birth of a child for fathers35. These new household dynamics have increased the use of several adaptation behaviors, including labor shifts between parents31 and the utilization of extended family members for primary childcare30,31,36. In addition, to characterize the balance of labor, it is essential to examine not only the workweek, but also the weekends37, particularly for researchers, who tend to have non-standard work schedule. Furthermore, studies of gender disparities in parenting often focus solely on mothers17 without comparative data on fathers. More nuanced research designs are necessary to understand how parental engagement influences research productivity and visibility beyond the current binary categorization of parenthood (that is, one that consider the presence of children rather than a spectrum of engagement with children).\\nTo understand the complex relationship between parenting and academic work, we employ a mixed methods approach utilizing: (1) statistical modelling of researcher productivity and visibility; and (2) an inductive qualitative coding technique to analyze free-text comments from survey respondents. Specifically, we consider how different models of parenting engagement and household arrangements are related to academic productivity and impact for men and women. We address the following research questions:\\nIs there a gendered difference in parenting engagement for researchers?\\nIs there a relationship between parental engagement and research productivity? If so, does this differ by gender and household composition?\\nIs there a relationship between degrees of parental leave and productivity by gender? If so, is this mediated by household composition?\\nIs there a gender difference between parenting engagement and scientific impact? If so, is this mediate by household composition?\\nA global database does not exist from which one could sample all active scientists with children. Therefore, we fielded a survey of 1.5 million publishing scientists in order to generate a sample and match that sample to bibliometric data. The final set of respondents (nâ€‰=â€‰11,226) represents one of the largest samples of publishing parents; however, the resultsâ€”particularly the inferential statistical testsâ€“should be interpreted in light of any potential response bias (given that the sample representsâ€‰<â€‰1% of the initial sampling frame).\\nResults\\nParenting labor by gender\\nAmong our respondents, women are more likely than men to serve as the primary caregiver for their children (30.6 vs. 3.9%) (Fig.Â\\xa01A). Inversely, more than a third of men (38.9%) indicated that they served in a secondary role in parenting (i.e., satellite), compared to only 17.4% of women. This establishes an important baseline for the study of scientific parenting: that is, women scholars are disproportionately likely to be taking a lead role in caregiving. The most common model, however, is one of shared parenting: the majority of men (57.1%) and women (52.0%) indicated that parenting roles were shared equally with their partner (i.e., dual).\\n(A) Parenting type by gender and household composition. (B) Respondents reporting themselves as the primary caregiver at different times of the day, by gender and parenting type. (C) Respondents reporting being a primary caregiver for the parenting-related activities, by gender and parenting type. Respondents are considered â€œprimary caregiverâ€� if they reported â€œMostly meâ€� or â€œAlmost always meâ€� in taking care of these activities. The asterisks denote the FDR-adjusted p-values from the two-sample tests of proportion between men and women:â€‰+â€‰pâ€‰<â€‰0.1, * pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, ** pâ€‰<â€‰0.01, *** pâ€‰<â€‰0.001.\\nThese self-reported roles were investigated to understand how they manifest themselves in terms of both time and task engagementâ€”that is, the times during which parents were engaging in parenting and the types of tasks with which they were disproportionately associated. Lead parents of both genders indicated high percentages of engagement across time compared to other roles, suggesting that the 3.9% of men serving in this role are strongly engaged in parenting. However, men in dual and satellite parenting roles were much less likely than women in the same roles to report primary caregiving across times. This demonstrates that there is a higher burden of labor for women to classify themselves as dual and satellite parents than men (Fig.Â\\xa01B). Men reinforced these disproportionate labor expectations, even in shared parenting relationships: â€œAlthough I try to be active in child care and share responsibilities equally, my wife still takes care of more child care tasks than I doâ€�. (M, Dual, US).\\nThe time results were confirmed by an analysis of tasks. In nearly every categoryâ€”particularly for dual and satellite parentsâ€”women were more likely to be the parent engaged in the caregiving tasks (Fig.Â\\xa01C, Table S1). There were fewer differences in how men and women operationalized lead parenting, with lead parents of both genders significantly engaged in childcare tasks. The only task where lead fathers demonstrated significant differences were in dropping off children at school/nursery (79.3 vs. 66.4%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=12.12, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) and coaching sports (40.8 vs. 17.7%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=53.66, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Much stronger gender differences were observed in dual parenting. Men in dual roles were more likely to drop off children at school/nursery (40.0 vs. 29.3%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=70.98, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), coach sports (30.5 vs. 5.6%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=625.04, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and do school/nursey pick-up (28.7 vs. 27.0%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=2, pâ€‰=â€‰0.168), though the latter was not significant. Women in dual roles were significantly more likely to be primarily responsible for all other caregiving duties. The same was true for satellite roles. The only task with which men were significantly more likely to be associated was coaching sports (25.8 vs. 5.1%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=188.44, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).\\nThe time and task analyses reinforce each other: when they self-identified as dual or satellite parents, women are disproportionately engaged in parenting activities. Furthermore, there is little difference between womenâ€™s labor performance in dual and satellite roles (Figure S1). These asymmetries between labor and credit show that, even in the perception of equality between parents, women carry a higher burden of labor.\\nQualitative responses were illuminating in this regard. A woman from Tunisia noted that the survey made her aware that she was the main caregiver. Other respondents supported this, but questioned the exhaustivity of the task list:\\nThis survey was instructive as I didnâ€™t realize how many tasks I take on compared to my partner. I thought it was more equal. Maybe there were tasks not listed. For example, he handles administrative tasks like keeping track of bank accounts, keeping the printer ink filled, and other tasks like basic cleaning within specific tasks (e.g., loading the dishwasher) and yard work. (W, Dual, US)\\nThe incompleteness of the list was also questioned by other respondents, but in the opposite direction, calling into focus the unequal cognitive and emotional labor performed by women:\\nThere is a huge cost to something that you didn\\'t ask about: \"running the house\" - it\\'s not just child care. It\\'s scheduling someone to come clean and/or cleaning, getting groceries, scheduling sitters, arranging for travel, paying bills, sorting the mail, getting the kids new clothes etc. etc. Often doctorâ€™s offices etc. have to be called during business hours and that takes away work time. It\\'s much, much more emotional work because I \"keep track\" of everything. We are traveling for work and need vaccines -- I am the one coordinating them. My husband helps, and definitely the physical aspects of taking care of the kids are 50/50 at least, but there\\'s all this other stuff. (W, Dual, US)\\nThe cognitive and emotional burdens of domestic labor disproportionately born by women have been well-recognized in previous studies38 and were manifest in the exogenous shock of the pandemic2,4,6. Therefore, the inequities observed in the itemization of task and time may only represent a conservative estimate of the actual difference in parenting engagement. However, our work demonstrates that self-report data of shared parenting discounts womenâ€™s engagement in parenting and overestimates menâ€™s.\\nWork arrangements and adaptation in parenting\\nOne limitation of the survey is that it captured individual nodes in dyadic relationships, rather than paired couples. One might expect, for example, different labor roles based on the occupation of the partner. To control for this, we identified the sector of employment of the partner, with a particular focus on situations where both the respondent and their partner were employed in academia. Academic couples arguably experience the same productivity pressures and job responsibilities as each other, creating a natural control for labor expectations. Overall, academic women as dual parents are strongly affected by having an academic partner: in terms of the task analysis, women with non-academic partners are primarily responsible for a larger number of tasks than their counterparts with academic partnersâ€”especially regarding transportation and evening care (Fig.Â\\xa02, Table S2). In contrast, academic men are much less affected by their academic partnership status except for dual parentsâ€“â€“those with an academic partner are more likely to do household shopping (23.9 vs. 18.8%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=7.9, pâ€‰=â€‰0.038) but less likely to do the school run (drop-off: 35.2 vs. 44.8%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=19.37, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002; pick-up: 22.7% vs. 30.0%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=13.91, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), put children to bed (14.7% vs. 19.3%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=7.61, pâ€‰=â€‰0.042), and read bedtime stories (26.6 vs. 21.8%, \\\\({\\\\chi }^{2}\\\\)=6.34, pâ€‰=â€‰0.043). For academic men as either lead or satellite parents, we found no statistically significant differences between those with and without an academic partner in parenting engagement (Fig.Â\\xa02, Table S3).\\nRespondents with an academic employment (nâ€‰=â€‰8,046) reporting being a primary caregiver for the parenting-related activities by parenting type, gender, and partner employment status (Academic vs. Non-academic). Respondents are considered â€œprimary caregiverâ€� if they reported â€œMostly meâ€� or â€œAlmost always meâ€� in taking care of these activities. The asterisks denote the FDR-adjusted p-values from the two-sample tests of proportion between those having an academic partner and their counterparts having a non-academic partner:â€‰+â€‰pâ€‰<â€‰0.1, * pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, ** pâ€‰<â€‰0.01, *** pâ€‰<â€‰0.001.\\nThe benefits of a partner who understands the labor burdens of academe was evident in the qualitative responses. For example, parents commented on the perceived flexibility of research careers and these advantages were enhanced when both parents were academics:â€œâ€¦My wife is also an academic which actually helped in sharing duties in a much more understanding wayâ€�. (M, Dual, Singapore).\\nHowever, whereas an academic career was seen as more flexible and therefore amenable to parenting, there was an assumption that flexibility also implied availability. This was most evident in respondents who were the sole academic in their household and the delicate balance between flexibility and availability was experienced by both women (â€œInevitably, we both feel that if a sacrifice must be made, it is my scheduleâ€� (W, Dual, US)) and men;\\nâ€œIt is hard to balance academic work and home life - as in many cases your partner does not understand that reading and working on your computer is your job. Thus, you find that you have various tasks (family, children, house, errands) thrown to you by your spouse who works a \"regular\" job because you are \"not busy\". (M, Dual, US)\\nWomen, however, are particularly affected by partner occupation, with significant differences in equity between those with and without academic partners. This suggests that spousal hiring programs may have stronger implications for women faculty in caregiving roles as the equitability of parenting tasks is higher with academic partners.\\nEffect of parental engagement on research productivity\\nAlthough parenting engagement and partner types account for only a small fraction of variations in productivity (after controlling for academic age, number of children, and discipline), certain patterns are revealing. As illustrated in Fig.Â\\xa03, both men and women suffer a productivity loss when they are single or lead parents. Using dual mothers with a non-academic partner as our reference group, dual fathers (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.05, pâ€‰=â€‰0.029) and satellite mothers (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.09, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004) are 5.6% and 8.9% more productive, respectively; single mothers are 15.3% less productive (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.17, pâ€‰=â€‰0.048) (Table S4). The differential effects of parenting engagement involving partnership status for men and women is confirmed in the two-academics subsample, where lead parents are, on average, 11.1% less productive than dual parents (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.12, pâ€‰=â€‰0.012), and the magnitude is roughly the same as the additional effects of being a lead father and being a lead mother with an academic partner in the full sample. This suggests that parenting penalties are felt by both men and women. As one respondent noted:\\nMy scientific productivity has declined since having kids- something had to give. I still work hard to be a good teacher and leader in my department while doing as much parenting as possible so my wife can pursue her career goals as well. The cost of the parenting has largely been a reduction in papers written. (M, Lead, US)\\nPredicted number of papers for men and women, by parenting engagement and partnership status. The dash line refers to the predicted productivity of our reference group: dual mothers with a non-academic partner. Results are averaged over the levels of number of children, academic employment status, doctoral degree, and domain. Intervals are back-transformed from the log scale.\\nDespite the positive but not significant effect on productivity of having an academic partner for dual mothers (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.05, pâ€‰=â€‰0.082), we saw an additional 10% decrease in productivity (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.11, pâ€‰=â€‰0.038) for lead mothers with an academic partner. This is tied with the reference point of dual mothers, where we see that dual mothers operate at similar levels of engagement as lead mothers. Perhaps counterintuitively, lead-mothers are as productive as dual mothers when they both have a non-academic partner (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.00, pâ€‰=â€‰0.862). This is in sharp contrast to lead fathers who suffer an additional 11.6% decrease in productivity (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.12, pâ€‰=â€‰0.11; not significant). This is likely a result of the unequal engagement women demonstrate in these parenting roles. Men seem to be most productive when they are in satellite roles with academic partners. Women, on the other hand, are most productive when they are in a satellite role with a non-academic partner. This may be a result of the perceived flexibility of academic roles intersecting with cultural expectations in parenting. As one woman observed: â€œYou have to be prepared to work twice as hard and accept that.â€�(W, Dual, UK).\\nEffects of parental leaves on production\\nParental leaves are associated with higher production, but have a point of diminishing return that varies by country (Fig.Â\\xa04, Table S5). The production advantage is highest at less than one month of leave for the US sample (estimated increase of 26.9%; Î²â€‰=â€‰0.24, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) and decreases for every three months of leave after (26.7% increase for longer than one but less than three months [Î²â€‰=â€‰0.24, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001], and 17.8% for three to six months [Î²â€‰=â€‰0.16, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001] among US women). The advantage disappears after six months with the US sample and after twelve months in the non-US sample. These cultural differences may be explained by the normative leave lengths and productivity expectations by country. One woman from the US explained how the casual terminology reinforced expectations of production during the limited leave given to US mothers:\\nThe six weeks after giving birth should be termed medical leave for the person who delivered the baby (regardless of if they are parenting the child). That should be treated as such. There are still people who will call it a \\'sabbatical\\'. (W, Dual, US)\\nPredicted number of papers by parental leave lengths and gender in the (A) US sample and (B) Non-US sample. The dash line refers to the predicted productivity of our reference group: dual mothers with a non-academic partner taking no parental leave. Results are averaged over the levels of parenting type, partnership status, number of children, academic employment status, doctoral degree, and domain. Intervals are back-transformed from the log scale.\\nWhile the effect is relatively modest in the non-US sample and non-significant for taking leaves less than one month (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.07, pâ€‰=â€‰0.609), the corresponding increase in number of papers is estimated to be 17.1%, 10.5%, and 10.6% for leaves longer than one but less than three months (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.18, pâ€‰<â€‰0.003), three to six months (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.10, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009), and longer than six but less than twelve months (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.10, pâ€‰=â€‰0.008). None of the interaction terms between gender and parental leave length are statistically significant, suggesting that the effect of parental leave length on production does not differ by gender. However, women are more likely to take leave and to take longer leave, leading to a disproportionate production disadvantage.\\nRespondents noted that family friendly policies did little to mediate the effects that labor demands on scientific production, including the necessity of managing ongoing growth of measures of academic impact over the lifetime of the career:\\nâ€œFamily friendly policies are all very well but basically just allow you to take time off work; they don\\'t reduce the amount of work that there is to do or remove deadlinesâ€�. (W, Lead, UK).\\nEffect of parenting engagement on scientific impact\\nTwo indicators of scientific impact are used to examine the relationship between parenting academic capital: number of total citations (TCS) and mean normalized citation scores (MNCS). While the first one is an absolute indicator largely dependent on researchersâ€™ number of papers, the indicates the average impact of their paper compared to other papers published in the same specialty within the same year. Results from the TCS and MNCS models are similar in magnitude and significance, although some notable differences exist (Fig.Â\\xa05, Table S4). The same differential effects of having an academic partner and being a lead parent for men and women on productivity is also present for impact. Having an academic partner for a dual mother increases impact by 11% (MNCS) (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.10, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) and 15.3% (TCS) (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.14, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004); whereas having an academic partner for a lead mother brings an additional decrease to impact by 17.1% (MNCS) (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.19, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) and 19.9% (TCS) (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.22, pâ€‰=â€‰0.022). In other words, the effect of being a lead parent for women is moderated by partnerâ€™s employment type in both production and impact.\\nPredicted productivity/impact based on parenting type, gender, and partnership status, faceted by (A) gender, (B) partnership status: (1) total number of papers, (2) total number of citations (TCS), (3) mean normalized citation scores (MNCS). The dash line refers to the predicted productivity/impact of our reference group: dual mothers with a non-academic partner. Results are averaged over the levels of number of children, academic employment status, doctoral degree, and domain (except for MNCS). Intervals are back-transformed from the log scale.\\nThe positive effect of being a satellite mother is only significant in the MNCS model (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.08, pâ€‰=â€‰0.019). The notable discrepancies between the two models relate to the moderating effect of gender on different aspects of the relationship between partnership status, parenting type, and impact. A dual father with an academic partner decreases MNCS by 9.6% (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.10, pâ€‰=â€‰0.031), whereas a lead father faces an additional 29.3% drop in TCS (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.35, pâ€‰=â€‰0.025). The former can be translated into the non-effect of academic partners for men and the latter the differential effects of being a lead parent for men and women. More specifically, being a lead parent has a negative effect on impact (TCS) for men regardless of their partnerâ€™s occupation, but for women only if their partner is an academic. This again is confirmed in both MNCS and TCS models fitted with the two-academics sample, where the lead parent effect for women is close to the interaction effect between lead parent and academic partner in the models with the full sample.\\nScientific impact is a function of visibility: work is more likely to be cited when authors are visible in the scientific community through collaboration, travel, and other forms of engagement. Therefore, it stands to reason that parenting demands that reduce visibility will translate into lower citation rates. Respondents often discussed how institutional policies were inadequate in compensating for demands of research careers (e.g., the necessity to travel, overnight stay and long, after-hours work). However, partners who are flexible and supportive were essential for engagement in the scientific community:\\nâ€œFlexible work hours are a blessing, but the travelling required for a successful career (conferences, networking, field work) is a nightmare. I am lucky to have a supportive partner, without whom I would not have been able to pull it offâ€�. (W, Dual, Sweden)\\nDiscussion and conclusion\\nOur analysis offers a novel lens by examining the cost of parenting engagement, as opposed to previous research that focuses on the binary existence of children as a reason for productivity disparities26,27,39,40. This work, therefore, provide insights on some of the unexplained productivity differences observed in earlier research which focused merely on the existence of but not engagement with children35. Parenting engagement is related with decreased research productivity and impact; however, the composition and management of the household plays an important role in mediating this effect. Results from our respondents show that the parenting penalty for men and women is amplified by their level of engagement in parenting activities. Differential participation in parenting may largely explain observed gender effects. Men who serve in lead roles suffer similar penalties, but women are more likely to serve in lead parenting roles and to be more engaged across time and tasks. In addition, despite respondents indicating that they engage in a dual parenting style, women still engaged in a significantly higher level of daily parenting tasks than men, which may explain the divergence in penalties between men and women in these roles. Simply put, women bear a higher burden of â€œreproductive laborâ€�32. Fathers suffer productivity penalties as their engagement increases; however, these penalties are felt more by women given that they are more likely to serve in lead roles and are more engaged in parenting, even when they report dual or satellite parenting styles.\\nResults suggest a zero-sum game between research productivity and parenting: the more engagement with parenting, the lower the productivity. Our work, therefore, provides evidence of one side of the bi-directional work-family tension33. Work and family have been described as â€œgreedy institutionsâ€�, which make loyalty demands on individuals33. The characterization of science as a vocation further amplifies this tension, as individuals are â€œcalledâ€� and develop their identity or â€œpersonalityâ€� through their craft. Furthermore, the incentive structure of in academe prioritize those who produce at extremely high levels, with seemingly infinite capacity for increase. As Frank Fox and colleagues observed: â€œWhen these standards for striving and excelling operate, or are idealized, work claims precedence among scientists, setting the stage for conflict with family.â€� Their analysis found that women demonstrate higher levels of conflict among women for both family on work and work on family. Our results confirm the former.\\nPolicies should account for this by creating greater permeability between work and family life to allow for parents to move more seamlessly between these professional and parenting responsibilities. It is the responsibility of the workplace, academic or otherwise, to make reasonable adjustments to the demands made by the work environment in order to adapt to the changing needs of its employees. For example, academic institutions should provide lactation rooms and on-campus childcare, to minimize the burden of transportation and shifting workspaces to meet parenting demands. Funding agencies should consider to support scholar parents. For example, the National Institutes of Health in the United States provides funding to offset childcare for funded doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows41. The Christiane NÃ¼sslein-Volhard Foundation in Germany provides funding for household chores and childcare42 stating that the â€œtime thus freed allows [women scholars] to continue working at a high standard, despite the double burden.â€� The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease provides funding for primary caregivers to hire technicians, to support their work when childcare demands are high. Professional conferences should also consider parenting needs by selecting safe locations, constructing management hours, and providing resources for childcare.\\nThis disproportionate engagement in parenting is exacerbated by the sector of employment of co-parents. There is greater equity in the distribution of parenting tasks when academic women are in dual partnerships with another academic, arguably because the labor expectations for both are shared. As Frank Fox and colleagues noted: â€œa match in spousal occupation creates potential synchrony, or shared understanding, of both work and family demands33â€�. Women in dual partnerships with non-academics do far more labor than their counterparts with academic partners. These inequities manifest in differences in productivity. Men and women scholars have lower productivity when they are single-parents and in lead parenting roles. Sharing parenting roles increases productivity for both, but womenâ€™s productivity is mediated by the occupation of their spouse: those with academic partners see a greater productivity gain than those without. Of course, non-academic roles are much more heterogeneous than academic roles, limiting our ability to interpret the cause of these differences (which operate in opposite ways for lead and satellite roles). However, the qualitative analysis of open-ended responses shed light on these tensions: academic work is seen as more flexible, therefore causing increased parenting burdens when academics are in partnerships with non-academics.\\nThese results are important for understanding dual-career academics, who represent a growing percentage of the academic workforce, and have higher rates among women than men34. One common consequence of dual-careers is the displacement of one careerâ€”in rank or geographyâ€”which largely disfavor women43. The phenomenon of the â€œtwo-body problemâ€� was visualized by NASA astronomer Margaret Thaller thus:\\nâ€œAs one body orbits the other, it tugs gravitationally on its partner, altering the original orbit. Then the second body does the same. In the end, thereâ€™s this give-and-take of a dance, as each body influences the other, constantly changing its path. The bigger, more massive body moves the leastâ€¦ the smaller body has to careen all over the place, trying to find the right place to fit into the co-orbit (Cf 36).â€�\\nInstitutions should create mechanisms to avoid such â€œcareeningâ€� and ensure stable positions for partnered scientists. Our findings suggest that women perform better when their partner is also an academic; therefore, spousal hiring tools may be important tools in achieving equity and minimizing the parenting penalty for women. For organizations willing to implement more gender- or parent-sensitive hiring policies, there is a potential to move beyond assessment of â€˜individualsâ€™ to one of â€˜couplesâ€™ recognizing the benefit brought to an organization by dual-academic couples. We do not overlook the complexity of this change in policy and practice, including the added difficulty of dual-assessment for couples from separate disciplines and therefore faculties, departments, or functional units of the organization (e.g., management). A further option would be to offer one-off research grants to academic partners of new hires to compensate for any perceived loss of research time due to the move.\\nThe analysis of parental leaves for US respondents suggests that the longer the leave, the lower the productivity. These differences, however, were not observed for non-US respondents. This could be due to the heterogeneity of parental leave policies across nations or the lack of parental leave within the US44. While the leave penalty is gender neutral (in that it applies to both mothers and fathers) our study follows earlier analysis in showing that mothers are disproportionately more likely to take leave28,44,45 and to take a longer leave than fathers. Fathers that do take parental leave are also more likely to have full-time working partners45, complying with the conceptualization of shared parenting used in this paper to illustrate the family/academic work dynamic of dual-academic households. This is conceptualization is likely to be even more acute in the immediate aftermath of the birth of a child, or when children are young. This creates an obvious tension: women place a high value on adequate leave policies when selecting an institution28; however, their use of this leave still places them at a disadvantage in terms of productivity.\\nScientific labor and success for an academic career largely reflects the pipeline model, with adherence to â€œideal worker norms39â€�. A recent study even referred to â€˜single ladiesâ€™ as the ideal-type of academic during COVID-19, due to the absence of responsibilities that would otherwise impede progress46. Given that pipeline model presents barriers to re-entry for those who deviate from this norm or suspend their progression9, family friendly policiesâ€”such as stopping the clock for tenure and longer maternity leavesâ€”that reinforce time away from research can lead to negative effects on careers. Leave policies, therefore, should not only include time away, but acknowledge the consequences of that leave for subsequent evaluations. As Morgan et al. observed, the productivity difference observed after childbirth would take mothers roughly five years of work to close28. It is no surprise, therefore, that taking a leave has a strong negative effect on the likelihood of promotion to full professor44. It does not benefit mothers to be allowed time away when they will be expected to compensate for that leave when they return.\\nResearch impact levels follow similar curves. Impact declines by engagement and is moderated by partner employment, with women in dual roles with an academic partner having higher levels of impact. This is likely a result of the ability to travel and be more visible in service and other professional engagement. Differences in impact, as measured by MNCS, are found to be non-significant for men and women and were in alignment with the time commitment expected from lead-, dual- and satellite parents. They were also not significant for academic couples, suggesting that, at least in part, couples adopt a strategy of cost-minimization to manage potential penalties. In particular, from the qualitative analysis, travel as a way of maintaining visibility in the discipline and maintain collaborations10, was found to be one of the most difficult academic responsibilities for parents to conduct, where a combination of structured- and unstructured-parenting strategies were necessary to minimize parenting penalty on scientific impact. Scientific organizations should take care to create equity in mobility programs and networking opportunities, to ensure that certain populations are not disadvantaged.\\nPersonal adaptation, however, places the burden upon the scholars and forces adaptations to meet the structural expectations of the â€œideal workerâ€�. A stronger and more sustainable policy approach would be for institutions to reimagine scientific work to embrace a more diverse workforce. Working demands that assume disengaged parenting disadvantages women. Equitable evaluation requires that institutions consider how their criteria can be applied fairly across populations. These policies, however, should not anchor on the absence of women in scienceâ€”that is, through longer leave programs, clock extensions, or virtual programming that allows distant participation. Rather, scientific organizations must imagine more creative ways in which women can be full participants in science. Diversity in science is not only a matter of justice, but is critical for a robust scientific ecosystem11.\\nOverall caution should be applied to the findings, due to the possibility of non-response bias. With that caveat in mind, however, the results support intuition: they reveal an association, across men and women, between the level of engagement in parenting activities and the academic outcomes under study. Men who serve in lead roles report similar penalties as women in those roles, but our sample indicates that women more frequently serve in lead parenting roles and are more engaged across time and tasks. Taking a period of parental leave is associated with higher levels of productivity; however, this association dissipates after 6Â\\xa0months for the US-sample, and at 12-months for the non-US sample. The findings provide reason for future research to overcome the sampling challenges faced in this study and develop research designs that allow for the measurement of the causal effect of parenting roles, not solely correlational analyses. The study also highlights the challenge of collecting data on global academics and offers exploratory, correlational evidence suggesting that parental engagement should be considered more extensively in explanations of gender differences in academic productivity (vis-Ã\\xa0-vis the mere existence of children), and policies should factor these labor differentials into account.\\nMaterials and methods\\nPopulation and sample\\nPopulation for this survey was defined as any first or last authors of 2007â€“2016 papers indexed in Clarivate Analyticsâ€™ Web of Science (WOS), for which an email address could be retrieved (Nâ€‰=â€‰2,640,872). A random sample of 1.5 million researchers was generated from this population, to which the survey was sent in 15 batches of 100,000 email invitations through Qualtrics between February 15 and March 8 of 2018. Only authors who identified as a parent were invited to proceed with the survey, after the first question (â€œDo you have children? (Yes/No)â€�). In total,15,917 researchers finished the survey, of which 14,910 identified as parents (nâ€‰=â€‰1007 as non-parents). Survey questions asked about the number of children, the years of birth, if and how much maternity/paternity leave was taken following the birth of each child, as well as their engagement in activities that were related to providing care/decision-making for children. In addition, demographic information on children and partners of respondents were included, as well as contribution to childcare and academic careers. Further data processing was performed to exclude incomplete, incomprehensible and anonymous responses, reducing the sample size to 11,226, or 75.3% of eligible responses. It should also be noted that nâ€‰=â€‰16 responses identified as other gender, and because of the small sample size, were subsequently excluded from the statistical analysis. Further research is encouraged to further this paperâ€™s findings with a larger, and more representative sample size this non-binary gender group.\\nThis subset of 11,226 respondents was then matched with their corresponding publication records in the WOS over the 1980â€“2017 period. Such publication records were automatically disambiguated using the algorithm developed by Caron and van Eck12, which uses heuristics such as researchersâ€™ field of study, institution of affiliation, collaborators and cited references to automatically reconstruct researchersâ€™ publication records and distinguish papers written by two or more authors that share the same name. This algorithm has been shown to have high precision and recall13, and to produce the best results among the existing disambiguation algorithms14. There were, however, respondents to which we were unable to match a publication record, and researchers for which no citation information was found were also excluded for the analysis (Nâ€‰=â€‰781 researchers). On the whole, the final sample analyzed contained 10,445 researchers, which represents 70.1% of all researchers who have finished the survey and met the criterion of being parents. This accounts for 0.70% of the set of sampled researchers, and for 0.40% of the entire population.\\nThe coverage of the sample varied by country (Table S6). English-speaking countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, accounted for more than 65% of all responses and are overrepresented. On the other hand, the majority of European countries exhibit a lower-than-average response rate, which is likely due to GDPR regulations. Asian countries also exhibit lower than average response date, which isâ€”at least in the case of Chinaâ€”due to the access limitations of Qualtrics. Therefore, our results have to be interpreted in the light of this uneven coverage of countries, with particular concern regarding the heterogeneity of leave policies within the underrepresented countries.\\nQuantitative analysis\\nThe analytic set for multiple linear regression models includes 10,013 respondents after excluding 432 with zero MNCS. The outcome variables are the number of publications indexed in WOS between 1980 and 2017 in the productivity model. For the impact model, both the number of total citations (TCS) and mean normalized citation scores (MNCS) are used as proxies for research impact. MNCS was used to allow comparisons over time and disciplines. Natural log transformation was applied to normalize the indicators. We identified three parenting types based on respondentsâ€™ caregiving situation (either current or when their children were dependents). Lead parents are the primary caregivers to their children, dual parents share equal parenting roles with either their partner or non-parental caregivers (e.g., grandparents, nannies), and satellite parents whose partner or non-parental others are primary caregivers for children. The lengths of parental leaves are divided into six categories: no leave, less than one month, at least one but less than three months, three to six months, more than six but less than 12Â\\xa0months, and 12Â\\xa0months or more.\\nTo test whether the relationship between parental engagement and research performance differs by gender and partnership status, we include a three-way interaction term between parenting type, partnership status, and gender. Partnership status is determined by the current occupation of respondentsâ€™ partner to be in an academic or non-academic sector. Academic partner is strictly referred to respondents whose partner is employed in academic sectors for research and/or teaching. Partners employed in government, private, or other sectors, as well as retired and not employed, are all designated as non-academic partner. To make our analysis more inclusive, single parents are assumed to be lead parents and are retained in the sample.\\nConsidering the strong presence of the US respondents in our sample and the fact that US is the only advanced country without a nation-wide parental leave policy, we split the sample into the US-only and non-US subsets when modeling the effect of parental leave lengths on productivity. In addition to the above-mentioned three-way interaction between parenting type, partnership status, and gender, we also include an interaction term between gender and parental leave lengths to examine whether the relationship between parental leave lengths and productivity differs by gender. We control for the number of children as well as respondentsâ€™ academic age, highest degree earned, employment sector, and primary discipline. Academic age is calculated based on the first and last years of publication plus one. Given that the effect of age is often multiplicative, we include academic age in its polynomial form and center the variable at the mean to render the intercept more meaningful and interpretable. Both the highest degree and employment sector are binary variables, indicating whether respondents hold a doctoral degree and work in an academic sector for research and/or teaching. Number of children is a nominal variable with four possible values: 1, 2, 3, as well as 4 and more; so is the main discipline, which is regrouped from the original 14 disciplines into four: Arts and Humanities, Health Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.\\nQualitative analysis\\nA free text section was included at the end of the survey that encouraged participants to â€œPlease feel free to add any additional comments you have regarding childcare and scientific labor, drawing upon your own experiencesâ€�. In total, 5976 participants completed this section. To analyze this large number of responses, analysis was separated into a 2-stage coding approach.\\nStage 1 coding involved a random sample of 1000 comments inductively coded using NVivo (Figure S5). Comments were coded into themes using a grounded theory-informed approach using a line-by-line analysis approach to identify main themes15,16,17. All inductive codes were then collapsed into 59 overarching axial codes, and then collapsed further to 8 codes (Table S18) which allowed the team to manually code the large number of remaining responses (nâ€‰=â€‰4976 comments) during Stage 2.\\nStage 2 coding was conducted in Excel to allow for swift and robust coding of the remaining responses. An additional â€˜Otherâ€™ category was permitted to retain data variability and richness as well as to elicit further codes as they gained prominence. In addition, extensive memo-making and reflexive note-taking during Stage 2 (Figure S6) was maintained to maximise the benefits of manual coding as well as to apply an appropriate level of sensitivity and nuance in its interpretation. This also allowed the quantitative data to speak and give voice to members of the research community.\\nWe drew exemplar quotes from the dominant themes to complement quantitative analyses at the end of Stage 2. Selection of these quotes ensured: fair representation of men and womenâ€™s parental voices; global coverage; as well as representation of the theme reflected in the Stage 2 code definition. The quotes here should be read as illustrative, but not a comprehensive reporting of the qualitative component of the survey.\\nEthics approval\\nAn application for ethical approval of this project was submitted on September 14, 2017 and approved on September 25, 2017 by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board. The protocol number is 1,706,832,059. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\\nInformed consent\\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants prior to data being collected.\\nData availability\\nAll data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in paper and/or the Supplementary Materials.\\nReferences\\nAndersen, J.

Social support from parents has demonstrated significant associations with academic outcomes, but less is known about the unique contributions of mothers and fathers. This study investigated the relation between maternal and paternal support with grades and attendance in early adolescence within the systemic framework of Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model. Free and reduced-price lunch status was used as a measure of financial hardship, and longitudinal analyses controlled for previous academic achievement as well as child age, gender, and ethnicity. Data included a large, diverse sample (52% White) of seventh and eighth graders (N\\u2009=\\u2009863; 52% male). Lunch status and academic performance outcomes were gathered from school records, and parental support was assessed using a self-report measure of support from mothers and fathers, the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale. Results highlighted risk in early adolescence was associated with decreasing grades and attendance over the course of a school year, but found that support from mothers and fathers reduced the decline in grades, as well as attendance. Mother and father support were associated with end of the year grade point average (GPA) and father support was associated with days absent. Finally, mother support moderated the association between financial hardship and GPA. Interventions to support the academic success of middle school students, and ways to facilitate positive school-family partnerships to promote supportive relationships are discussed.\\nHighlights\\nOur study investigated the role of mother and father support and family socio-economic hardship on academic outcomes over time with a diverse sample of middle school youth; findings indicated that early adolescence was associated with decreasing grades and attendance.\\nSupport from both mothers and fathers was associated with higher grades, regardless of financial hardship.\\nSupport from both mothers and fathers was protective in mitigating the decline in GPA over time and mother support moderated the association between financial stress and GPA.\\nResults stress the important role of parent social support in promoting positive school-based outcomes in youth.\\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\\nto check access.\\nAccess this article\\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\\nRent this article via DeepDyve\\nInstitutional subscriptions\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nParental Involvement and Adolescents’ Educational Success: The Roles of Prior Achievement and Socioeconomic Status\\nAprile D.

The distinction between the activities parents partake in and the attitude parents have towards education was highlighted by several recent studies. Several studies found that increased frequency of activities was associated with higher levels of child misbehavior in the classroom (Izzo, Weissberg, Kasprow, & Fendrich, 1999), whereas positive attitudes towards education and school were associated with the child's increased academic performance (Rimm-Kaufman, Pianta, Cox, & Bradley, 2003). Specifically, Izzo et al.

Previous research has shown that unfavorable changes in the composition of the microbiome can increase disposition to diseases such as diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated the relationship between human migration and microbiome composition through a review using microbiome- and migration-related search terms in PubMed and Web of Science. We included articles examining the gut, oral, or oropharyngeal microbiome in people who migrated internationally. Nine articles met eligibility criteria. All but one examined migration from a non-Western to a Western country. Four of these found a difference in the microbiome of migrants compared with non-migrating residents of their country of birth, seven found differences in the microbiome of migrants compared with the native-born population in the country of resettlement, and five found microbiome differences associated with duration of stay in the country of resettlement. Microbiome composition varies with country of birth, age at migration, time since immigration, and country of resettlement. The results suggest that migration may lead to changes in the microbiome; thus, microbiome characteristics are a plausible pathway to examine changes in health after resettlement in a new country.\\r\\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\\r\\nto check access.\\r\\nAccess this article\\r\\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\\r\\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\\r\\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\\r\\nRent this article via DeepDyve\\r\\nInstitutional subscriptions\\r\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\r\\nMicrobiome and health implications for ethnic minorities after enforced lifestyle changes\\r\\nDavid M.

Some of the cross-population microbiome studies suggested plausible correlations between GM composition and disease susceptibility (Table \\u200b(Table1).1). Fecal metagenomic markers for T2D were found to differ between European and Chinese populations, suggesting that fecal metagenomic predictive tools for T2D should be specific for different geographical populations (Karlsson et al., 2013).\\r\\nTable 1\\r\\nGeographical/racial variations in gut microbiome composition and diversity.\\r\\nEC, Enzyme commission numbers.\\r\\nGradual transition of the gut microbiota composition with changes in the host subsistence strategies.\\r\\nAll these studies revealed some general trends in evolution of human GM with gradual transition in host subsistence pattern (Figure \\u200b(Figure2).2). The most apparent trend is significantly higher microbial diversity in guts of foraging people and its gradual reduction with westernization in the host community (Schnorr et al., 2014). For instance, the microbiome profiles of the agriculturalist Bantu population exhibit an intermediate state between the microbiomes of Pygmy hunter-gatherers and those of US individuals (Obregon-Tito et al., 2015; Gomez et al., 2016). It has been proposed that the high taxonomic diversity in the wandering foragers might have endowed their gastrointestinal ecosystem with greater stability and functional flexibility, enabling them to withstand the perpetual presence of pathogens or parasites and to respond to fluctuations in diet due to unpredictable and seasonally dependent food supply (Morton et al., 2015).\\r\\nDivergence in the GM composition, especially the Prevotella-Bacteroides trade-off between the hunter-gatherers and western people is often attributed to their dietary specialization (O'Keefe et al., 2007; Ou et al., 2013; Gomez et al., 2016). Prevotella is thought to enhance the ability to digest and extract valuable nutrition from fibrous plant foods and Treponema also might be advantageous to nutritional acquisition of traditional people because of its fibrinolytic specializations (Obregon-Tito et al., 2015). As compared to foraging populations, the agriculturalists and urban industrialized people exhibit an appreciable enrichment in carbohydrate- and xenobiotic-processing presumably due to their access to more digestible sugars and therapeutic drugs (Gomez et al., 2016).\\r\\nThe role of host genetics in shaping the GM is not very clear yet (Goodrich et al., 2016), though there were some reports on ethnicity or geography-specific variations in GM (Yatsunenko et al., 2012). Yatsunenko et al. noticed a basal level of influence of family and shared environment on microbiome structure, which was found to be fairly consistent across US, Malawian and Amerindian communities (Yatsunenko et al., 2012). Analysis of fecal microbiota of infants, genetically at high risk for Type I Diabetes at six clinical centers in Europe (Finland, Sweden, and Germany) and the U.S. (Colorado, Washington state, and Georgia/Florida) revealed significant association of geographical origin with the diversity and the relative abundance of different bacterial genera, especially of Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium, Streptococcus, and Akkermansia in GM (Kemppainen et al., 2015). The study found significantly lower diversity in the fecal microbiota of Finland and Colorado babies, which was in good agreement with an earlier report on reduction in GM diversity in infants from northern European countries as compared to southern or central European infants (e.g., Sweden vs. Spain and Finland vs. Germany), irrespective of the delivery mode, breast-feeding and antibiotics exposure (Fallani et al., 2010). Geographical and population-specific factors might also have influenced IBD associated changes in gut ecosystems, as indicated by increase in abundance of Firmicutes in GM of IBD patients in European (Germany and Lithuania) population but not in South Asian (Indian) population (Rehman et al., 2016).\\r\\nHowever, in many cases, the mode of subsistence exhibited specific microbiome signatures that seemed to overrule ethnic background. For instance, the Bantu-farming and Bantu-fishing communities though sharing the same genetic ancestry, show larger differences in gut microbiome profiles between themselves than between the Pygmies and Bantu-farming population (Morton et al., 2015).\", start_char_idx=46210, end_char_idx=50869, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8650450970009791)], metadata={'e3d1f01d-7890-49cc-a9b4-9188b26cfeca': {'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\avikm\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\convergent\\\\bt_ir\\\\tavily_data\\\\demofile3.txt', 'file_name': 'c:/Users/avikm/OneDrive/Desktop/convergent/bt_ir/tavily_data/demofile3.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 36031, 'creation_date': '2024-04-01', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-01'}, '4134543e-550a-4e97-8a7d-16a6816e2cad': {'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\avikm\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\convergent\\\\bt_ir\\\\tavily_data\\\\demofile0.txt', 'file_name': 'c:/Users/avikm/OneDrive/Desktop/convergent/bt_ir/tavily_data/demofile0.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 82173, 'creation_date': '2024-04-01', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-01'}})"
