Studies have shown that when parents are actively engaged in their children's education by participating in school activities, volunteering, supporting learning at home, and maintaining positive attitudes towards education, students tend to exhibit higher academic achievement, school engagement, motivation, improved reading skills, language comprehension, and expressive language skills. Additionally, parental involvement has been associated with positive social and emotional outcomes for students, such as higher self-esteem, enjoyment of school, and decreased instances of delinquency.
