      " Researchers have reported that parent-child interactions, specifically stimulating and responsive parenting practices, are important influences on a child's academic development (Christian, Morrison, & Bryant, 1998; Committee on Early Childhood Pedagogy, 2000).  By examining specific parenting practices that are amenable to change, such as parent involvement, and the mechanisms by which these practices influence academic performance, programs may be developed to increase a child's academic performance.  While parent involvement has been found to be related to increased academic performance, the specific mechanisms through which parent involvement exerts its influence on a child's academic performance are not yet fully understood (Hill & Craft, 2003).  Understanding these mechanisms would inform further research and policy initiatives and may lead to the development of more effective intervention programs designed to increase children's academic performance.\n",
      " Models of Parent Involvement\n",
      "Parent involvement has been defined and measured in multiple ways, including activities that parents engage in at home and at school and positive attitudes parents have towards their child's education, school, and teacher (Epstein, 1996; Grolnick & Slowiaczek, 1994; Kohl, Lengua, & McMahon, 2000).  The distinction between the activities parents partake in and the attitude parents have towards education was highlighted by several recent studies. \n",

      "Examined as multiple mediators, perceived cognitive competence fully mediated the relation between parent involvement and the child's WIAT-II score, over and above the influence of the quality of the student-teacher relationship.  It may be the case that the variance of the relation between parent involvement and WIAT-II score is already explained by the child's perception of cognitive competence.  In addition, the student-teacher relationship was a full mediator of the relation between parent involvement and teacher ratings of the child's classroom academic performance.  This is one of the first studies to examine a mechanism by which parent involvement is related to a child's academic performance.  Two statistical techniques to test for mediation were used, further confirming the findings.\n",

Moreover, family socioeconomic status (SES), related developmental resources (including parental support, expectations, and reading resources), and students’ individual reading motivation (including reading engagement and reading confidence) also affect adolescents’ learning outcomes (including academic achievement, school grades, and reading competence) (Mudrak et al., 2020).\n",
       "With the increase in communication time between adolescent students and their peers, they gradually break away from their families to participate in peer interaction; peers have become another major field affecting their development (Criss et al., 2016). The interpersonal relationship established by teenagers in the school field plays an essential role in their behavior development, cognitive ability, and academic performance, especially adolescents’ academic engagement or learning performance is influenced by friendship quality (Sebanc et al., 2016), friends’ gain and loss (Lessard and Juvonen, 2018), and peer personality (Golsteyn et al., 2021) factors in peer groups.

The family environment (parenting style, behavior supervision, and emotional intervention) plays a decisive role in the quality of peer interaction among adolescents; for example, parents supervise their children’s home time, places to go out, friend interactions, and homework completion, which would increase children’s exposure to peers with positive learning behaviors (Deutsch et al., 2012; DeAnna, 2016), which indicates that parent–child communication and parental educational involvement influence children’s interpersonal interactions. At the same time, the peer network structure, friend quality, and personality orientation also affect students’ academic achievement (Berthelon et al., 2019; Golsteyn et al., 2021). Based on the available research, a more superior family environment may have a positive effect on students’ academic achievement by increasing their peer interaction quality.\n",

Parental involvement in education, supervision of their children's activities, and emotional intervention can also play a decisive role in the quality of peer interaction among adolescents, which in turn influences students' academic achievement. Furthermore, parents' educational expectations for their children can impact their academic performance. If these expectations are moderate and align with the child's self-expectations, it can be conducive to the child's academic achievement. However, if parents' expectations are much higher than their children's self-expectations, it can lead to stress and harm academic achievement.\n"
