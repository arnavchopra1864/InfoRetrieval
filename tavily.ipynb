      "Future policy should focus on developing and promoting school programs that enable parents to increase a child's perception of cognitive competence, and fund future research to better understand the mechanisms by which this occurs.  School administrators should consider ways to improve the student-teacher relationship, given its important relation with the child's academic performance.  For instance, school administrators may set aside time in the curriculum for team building exercises between students, teachers, and parents.  Taken together, the present study identified mechanisms by which parent involvement is related to a child academic performance, over and above the impact of the child's IQ, and it is the hope that these findings lead to further research and new policies to increase a child's academic performance.\n",

      "The purpose of the present study was to examine the ability of the child's perceived cognitive competence and the quality of the student-teacher relationship to explain the relation between parent involvement and the child's academic performance.  Findings from the present study demonstrated that increased parent involvement, defined as the teacher's perception of the positive attitude parents have toward their child's education, teacher, and school, was significantly related to increased academic performance, measured by both a standardized achievement test and teacher ratings of the child's classroom academic performance.  Further, parent involvement was significantly related to academic performance above and beyond the impact of the child's intelligence (IQ), a variable not accounted for in previous research.\n",

This is measured by both a standardized achievement test and teacher ratings of the child's classroom academic performance. Additionally, parental involvement is significantly related to academic performance above and beyond the impact of the child's intelligence (IQ).

Moreover, family socioeconomic status (SES), related developmental resources (including parental support, expectations, and reading resources), and students’ individual reading motivation (including reading engagement and reading confidence) also affect adolescents’ learning outcomes (including academic achievement, school grades, and reading competence) (Mudrak et al., 2020).\n",
       "With the increase in communication time between adolescent students and their peers, they gradually break away from their families to participate in peer interaction; peers have become another major field affecting their development (Criss et al., 2016). The interpersonal relationship established by teenagers in the school field plays an essential role in their behavior development, cognitive ability, and academic performance, especially adolescents’ academic engagement or learning performance is influenced by friendship quality (Sebanc et al., 2016), friends’ gain and loss (Lessard and Juvonen, 2018), and peer personality (Golsteyn et al., 2021) factors in peer groups.

The family environment (parenting style, behavior supervision, and emotional intervention) plays a decisive role in the quality of peer interaction among adolescents; for example, parents supervise their children’s home time, places to go out, friend interactions, and homework completion, which would increase children’s exposure to peers with positive learning behaviors (Deutsch et al., 2012; DeAnna, 2016), which indicates that parent–child communication and parental educational involvement influence children’s interpersonal interactions. At the same time, the peer network structure, friend quality, and personality orientation also affect students’ academic achievement (Berthelon et al., 2019; Golsteyn et al., 2021). Based on the available research, a more superior family environment may have a positive effect on students’ academic achievement by increasing their peer interaction quality.\n",

They can cultivate their child's information literacy, improve math and reading scores, and directly stimulate cognitive development by communicating with their children, visiting museums, or recording daily activities. Family socioeconomic status (SES), related developmental resources such as parental support, expectations, and reading resources, and students’ individual reading motivation also affect adolescents’ learning outcomes. Parental involvement in education, supervision of their children's activities, and emotional intervention can also play a decisive role in the quality of peer interaction among adolescents, which in turn influences students' academic achievement. Furthermore, parents' educational expectations for their children can impact their academic performance. If these expectations are moderate and align with the child's self-expectations, it can be conducive to the child's academic achievement. However, if parents' expectations are much higher than their children's self-expectations, it can lead to stress and harm academic achievement.\n"
