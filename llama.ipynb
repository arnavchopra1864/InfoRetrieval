      "Sleep is crucial for athletes for several reasons. It can enhance performance and is a key determinant of athletic success. Lack of adequate sleep can lead to poor self-assessment in terms of sleep need, duration, and quality, which can negatively impact an athlete's performance. Training volume and schedules can also affect sleep, with increased training loads and early morning training often leading to decreased sleep duration and quality. \n",

Studies have shown that athletes who sleep less than 8 hours per night are 70% more likely to report an injury than those who sleep more. Sleep loss can impair reaction time and cognitive function, which could increase the risk of acute injury. \n",

      "In addition to physical health and performance, sleep also impacts mental health. Athletes may experience stress from various sources, and this can be exacerbated by impairments in sleep duration and quality. Therefore, early identification and management of mental health issues in athletes is critical for improved sleep, health, and performance. \n",
