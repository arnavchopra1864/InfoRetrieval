Abstract
Early adolescence is a time of unique risks in relation to academic outcomes, and family socioeconomic adversity poses added risk. Social support from parents has demonstrated significant associations with academic outcomes, but less is known about the unique contributions of mothers and fathers. This study investigated the relation between maternal and paternal support with grades and attendance in early adolescence within the systemic framework of Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model. Free and reduced-price lunch status was used as a measure of financial hardship, and longitudinal analyses controlled for previous academic achievement as well as child age, gender, and ethnicity. Data included a large, diverse sample (52% White) of seventh and eighth graders (N = 863; 52% male). Lunch status and academic performance outcomes were gathered from school records, and parental support was assessed using a self-report measure of support from mothers and fathers, the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale. Results highlighted risk in early adolescence was associated with decreasing grades and attendance over the course of a school year, but found that support from mothers and fathers reduced the decline in grades, as well as attendance. Mother and father support were associated with end of the year grade point average (GPA) and father support was associated with days absent. Finally, mother support moderated the association between financial hardship and GPA. Interventions to support the academic success of middle school students, and ways to facilitate positive school-family partnerships to promote supportive relationships are discussed.
Highlights
Our study investigated the role of mother and father support and family socio-economic hardship on academic outcomes over time with a diverse sample of middle school youth; findings indicated that early adolescence was associated with decreasing grades and attendance.
Support from both mothers and fathers was associated with higher grades, regardless of financial hardship.
Support from both mothers and fathers was protective in mitigating the decline in GPA over time and mother support moderated the association between financial stress and GPA.
Results stress the important role of parent social support in promoting positive school-based outcomes in youth.
