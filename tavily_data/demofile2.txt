Fourier Transform
The Fourier transform is a generalization of the complex Fourier series in the limit as . Replace the discrete
with the continuous
while letting . Then change the sum to an integral,
and the equations become
Here,
is called the forward () Fourier transform, and
is called the inverse () Fourier transform. The notation
is introduced in Trott (2004, p. xxxiv), and
and
are sometimes also used to denote the Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform,
respectively (Krantz 1999, p. 202).
Note that some authors (especially physicists) prefer to write the transform in terms of angular frequency
instead of the oscillation frequency . However, this destroys the symmetry, resulting in the transform
pair
To restore the symmetry of the transforms, the convention
is sometimes used (Mathews and Walker 1970, p. 102).
In general, the Fourier transform pair may be defined using two arbitrary constants
and
as
The Fourier transform
of a function
is implemented the Wolfram
Language as FourierTransform[f,
x, k], and different choices of
and
can be used by passing the optional FourierParameters->
a,
b
option. By default, the Wolfram Language
takes FourierParameters as . Unfortunately, a number of other conventions are in widespread
use. For example,
is used in modern physics,
is used in pure mathematics and systems engineering,
is used in probability theory for the computation of the characteristic
function,
is used in classical physics, and
is used in signal processing. In this work, following
Bracewell (1999, pp. 6-7), it is always assumed that
and
unless otherwise stated. This choice often results
in greatly simplified transforms of common functions such as 1, , etc.
Since any function can be split up into even and odd portions
and ,
a Fourier transform can always be expressed in terms of the Fourier cosine transform and Fourier sine transform
as
A function
has a forward and inverse Fourier transform such that
provided that
1.
exists.
2. There are a finite number of discontinuities.
3. The function has bounded variation. A sufficient weaker condition is fulfillment of the Lipschitz
condition
(Ramirez 1985, p. 29). The smoother a function (i.e., the larger the number of continuous derivatives), the more compact its Fourier
transform.
The Fourier transform is linear, since if
and
have Fourier transforms
and , then
Therefore,
The Fourier transform is also symmetric since
implies .
Let
denote the convolution, then the transforms of convolutions
of functions have particularly nice transforms,
The first of these is derived as follows:
where .
There is also a somewhat surprising and extremely important relationship between the autocorrelation and the Fourier transform
known as the Wiener-Khinchin theorem.
Let ,
and
denote the complex conjugate of , then the Fourier transform of the absolute
square of
is given by
The Fourier transform of a derivative
of a function
is simply related to the transform of the function
itself. Consider
Now use integration by parts
with
and
then
The first term consists of an oscillating function times . But if the function is bounded so that
(as any physically significant signal must be), then the term vanishes, leaving
This process can be iterated for the th derivative to yield
The important modulation theorem of Fourier transforms allows
to be expressed in terms of
as follows,
Since the derivative of the Fourier transform is given
by
it follows that
Iterating gives the general formula
The variance of a Fourier transform is
and it is true that
If
has the Fourier transform , then the Fourier transform has the shift
property
so
has the Fourier transform
If
has a Fourier transform , then the Fourier transform obeys a similarity
theorem.
so
has the Fourier transform
The "equivalent width" of a Fourier transform is
The "autocorrelation width" is
where
denotes the cross-correlation of
and
and
is the complex conjugate.
Any operation on
which leaves its area unchanged leaves
unchanged, since
The following table summarized some common Fourier transform pairs.
In two dimensions, the Fourier transform becomes
