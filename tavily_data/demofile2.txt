Parenting and Child Development: A Relational Health
Perspective
Abstract
A child’s development is embedded within a complex system of relationships. Among
the many relationships that influence children’s growth and development, perhaps
the most influential is the one that exists between parent and child.
Recognition of the critical importance of early parent-child relationship
quality for children’s socioemotional, cognitive, neurobiological, and health
outcomes has contributed to a shift in efforts to identify relational
determinants of child outcomes. Recent efforts to extend models of relational
health to the field of child development highlight the role that parent, child,
and contextual factors play in supporting the development and maintenance of
healthy parent-child relationships. This review presents a parent-child
relational health perspective on development, with an emphasis on socioemotional
outcomes in early childhood, along with brief attention to obesity and eating
behavior as a relationally informed health outcome. Also emphasized here is the
parent–health care provider relationship as a context for supporting healthy
outcomes within families as well as screening and intervention efforts to
support optimal relational health within families, with the goal of improving
mental and physical health within our communities.
‘Viewing development through the lens of relational health reflects recognition
of the critical role that relationships play in children’s social, emotional,
health, and cognitive outcomes.’
“In order to develop normally, a child requires progressively more
complex joint activity with one or more adults who have an irrational
emotional relationship with the child. Somebody’s got to be crazy about that
kid. That’s number one. First, last and always.”—Urie
Bronfenbrenner
Introduction
Bronfenbrenner recognized the critical importance of the emotional relationship
between a child and an adult, whereas Bowlby’s observation underscores the
responsibility of communities and practitioners in supporting healthy child
development by supporting parents. The belief that we can support children directly,
without supporting their parents, overlooks the complex system of relationships
within which children develop.1 Together, Bronfenbrenner and Bowlby remind us that to support healthy
development, we must focus on the emotional quality of the relationships within
which the child participates—as well as consider how the larger community supports
those relationships.
Yet parenting is a broad topic and an exhaustive review is beyond the scope of any
one article. Informed by the field of infant mental health with its explicit
relational focus2 and in an effort to contribute to our understanding of parenting as multiply determined,3 we focus our discussion here on the construct of relational health as a tool
for promoting socioemotional and physical health among young children. Relational
health reflects a sense of “connectedness” with attuned others, including
caregivers, family members, and other individuals within the community.4 Such a focus is consistent with the field of lifestyle medicine—which
considers the environment as a social determinant of health and well-being5—and research on health and social behavior, which highlights parents as
significant influences on children’s health.6 Viewing development through the lens of relational health reflects
recognition of the critical role that relationships play in children’s social,
emotional, health, and cognitive outcomes.3 Accordingly, the revised Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and
Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC-05)7 considers how characteristics of the broader caregiving environment, such as
coparenting quality and other close relationships, relate to developmental and
mental health diagnoses.2
Relational Health Within Primary Care: The Parent-Provider Relationship
We suggest that the parent-provider relationship provides a potentially valuable,
although far less emphasized, context for promoting relational health. We present a
review of the literature surrounding relational health science and encourage the
health care provider to view their patients through the relational health lens. When
considered from this angle, for children and their caregivers, the
relationship is the patient. As health care providers endeavor
to encourage healthy lifestyle choices in the families they serve, each decision a
family makes—whether to the benefit or detriment—will occur in the context of their
relationships. The health care provider must learn to consider and then acknowledge
the family support relationships present in the exam room, the waiting room, and at
home to best engage a family’s healthy choices. When caring for patients through
this approach, the provider will consider the patient’s treatment choices in their
realistic and relational context, rather than as compliant versus noncompliant.
Moreover, by acknowledging the provider’s own relationship to the family, the
provider can become a supportive member of the treatment decision team rather than
an information broker, motivational interviewer, or reticent supplier of
difficult-to-follow advice.
The relational health perspective considers the practitioner as a supportive (or
unsupportive) “other” in navigating the sometimes difficult, uncertain, or
fear-provoking experience of parenting a child from preconception through adulthood.
An awareness of relational health in pediatric and adult medicine settings may
increase positive outcomes in both parents and children through increased empathy.
Specifically, during challenging situations, the practitioner should assess and
address relationship quality rather than judging parenting or assigning sole credit
or blame to either the parent or child. The focus lies in identifying strengths and
opportunities in service to the relationship.4
Relational Health Within Families: The Parent-Child Relationship
A relational health perspective on development embodies a family systems perspective
as well, which recognizes the interconnectedness of individuals and relationships
within families8 and the bidirectional, transactional nature of relationships9; parents affect children and children affect parents.10 A relational health approach to understanding parent-child relationships
emphasizes the dyadic connection between parent and child. Although a multitude of
factors have been explored as correlates and predictors of parenting and child
outcomes, we focus here on a subset of the factors that may influence relational
health, with the goal of increasing practitioners’ understanding of
relationship-focused approaches to health promotion within families.
Parent-Child Attachment Relationships: Parental Sensitivity and Reflective
Functioning
One of the most influential relationship-focused frameworks for understanding
development is attachment theory. An extensive literature describes the early
parent-child attachment relationship as an enduring, emotional bond that enables
children to explore the environment,11 yet maintain the proximity and contact necessary for healthy development.
Parent-infant attachment relationships, therefore, provide the earliest contexts
for children’s relational health. Secure attachment balances developmentally
appropriate exploration of the world with seeking closeness and comfort from the
caregiver when distressed. Secure parent-child attachment relationships are
associated with a range of positive social and emotional outcomes in
children.12,13 Conversely, disorganized attachment, a form of insecure
attachment, is a risk factor for poorer developmental outcomes14 and has been linked to disturbed caregiving behavior.15-17 Efforts aimed at
increasing security within these critical early relationships remain of interest
to researchers and clinicians.18 Interventions including Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up
(ABC),19,20 Circle of Security,21 and Video Intervention for Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD)22 have been effective in promoting secure attachment and positive child
outcomes (including fewer behavior problems) via creation of measurable,
positive changes in parents’ sensitive and responsive behavior, a key factor in
secure attachment.23,24 Yet these interventions are not widely available to the
public, thus limiting the ability of clinicians to offer them to their patients
and families.
Perhaps the most effective mediator toward creating change in parental
sensitivity and responsiveness is fostering growth in a parent’s reflective
functioning (RF). RF reflects the extent to which a parent can consider the
mental states (ie, thoughts, feelings, intentions) that may motivate the
behavior of self and other.25 This capacity can be described in terms of both self-focused RF and
child-focused RF.26,27 Interventions such as Minding the Baby28,29 and
Mothering from the Inside Out30,31 appear effective in
supporting healthy relational outcomes via a focus on growing RF. The concept of
RF is also relevant for understanding how adults’ own early relational
experiences may affect their parenting.32
These 2 elements of parenting—sensitive, responsive caregiving and RF—support
the formation of secure parent-child relationships.24 We suggest that health care providers use thoughtful questioning that
may support parental RF, as recently suggested and detailed by Ordway et al.33 Health care providers can also demonstrate and model RF and help
build this capacity in families via routine care and also in medically
intensive environments. In environments such as the neonatal intensive care
unit (NICU), for example, barriers to parent-neonate relational health
development are prominent because of parents coping with fears of infant
death and infants experiencing frequent stressors.34-39 Although NICU staff
recognize the critical role they play in supporting early parent-child
relational health and promoting positive socioemotional outcomes among
infants born prematurely,40 this role may come secondary to the provision of direct medical
support to neonates. Professionals’ engagement in reflective practice, with
its focus on awareness of the mental and feeling states of self and others,41 may be one pathway toward promoting positive infant outcomes via the
provision of greater psychological support to parents of premature and
medically fragile newborns. Building reflective capacity among a range of
health care providers may further strengthen the foundation of early
relational health within families.33
Mothering, Fathering, and Grandparenting
Although attachment perspectives historically have emphasized the mother-child
relationship, attachment theory and research has been extended to a variety of
other caregiver-child relationships, including father-child
relationships.42-44 A family
systems perspective8 on relational health suggests that to understand development, we must
consider how mother-child and father-child relationships may independently or
interactively contribute to developmental outcomes.
Rigorous recent research indicates that children benefit socially and emotionally
when fathers are more involved in their lives.45 Moreover, the benefits of father involvement hold for nonresident as well
as resident fathers.46 Yet fathers’ engagement in parenting is multiply determined,47 and individual, family, and institutional-level factors may all play
important roles in predicting paternal involvement. At an individual level, a
father’s identity as a parent,48,49 as well as a father’s
attitudes and beliefs about his role in his child’s life,50,51 matter for
his engagement. At the family level, evidence highlights the quality of the
father’s relationship with a child’s mother. For example, mothers are more
likely to be gatekeepers within families, controlling fathers’ access to
children as well as the quantity and quality of fathers’ interactions with their
children.52,53 At a policy level, compared with countries such as Sweden
where paternal leave is supported, the lack of paid paternal leave within the
United States may also present barriers to fathers’ involvement with their young
children as well as erode fathers’ sense of efficacy in the parental role.54
Above and beyond these individual, family, and policy variables, mothers’ and
fathers’ parenting may differ and uniquely predict developmental outcomes. For
example, mothers may be the primary providers of emotional security for children
via the establishment of early parent-child attachment relationships, whereas
for fathers, exploration of the world may be a primary emphasis in parenting.55 Fathers’ more stimulating play style—often involving rough-and-tumble
play—may promote positive outcomes in children, including developmentally
appropriate risk taking and establishment of autonomy.56,57 Mothers, by contrast, are
more likely to engage in object-mediated teaching interactions as well as
providing structure for their children.58 However, though mothers and fathers may have interaction styles that
differ, the fact remains that many children in the United States are raised in
households headed by mothers and may experience wide variability in contact with
their biological fathers.59 This fact, coupled with increasing acceptance and prevalence of families
headed by same-sex parents, cautions against a return to the belief that to
develop optimally, children require both fathers and mothers (known as the
“essential father” hypothesis).60
We must also recognize that nonparental primary caregivers may play a central
role in the care and raising of young children. For example, the increasing
number of grandparent-headed households means that more grandparents—with their
own sets of strengths and challenges—are making health and wellness decisions
for children and may require a unique set of supports from health care providers.61 Even when not primary caregivers, many grandparents—especially maternal
grandmothers—report being involved and influential in their grandchildren’s lives.62 In fact, involvement of maternal grandmothers with grandchildren may
buffer young children from the risks to their development posed by difficult
temperament and harsh parenting by mothers.63 A wider relational health perspective suggests that grandparents (both
custodial and noncustodial) be considered as potential sources of support in
children’s health and well-being.
Shifting demographics suggest that fathers, nonparental caregivers, and
grandparents play an active and involved role in the lives of children. As
providers, recognition of the range of relationships in which the child is
embedded is critical. Examining potential biases around who is most
knowledgeable or best equipped to care for children may help providers
approach each adult who is involved in the child’s life as a potential
partner in health promotion.64
Coparenting Relationships
The recognition that children develop within relationships between multiple
caregivers, including mothers, fathers, grandparents, and others, makes it
critical to also consider the health of the relationships among these adults
(ie, coparents) who share responsibility for raising particular
children.65,66 Whereas constructs such as marital quality or marital
satisfaction focus on the intimate partner relationship, the coparenting
relationship, although related, is separate and distinct. Coparenting reflects a
wider range of relationship structures and processes specific to
parenting.67,68 For example, coparenting relationships occur among a
variety of individuals who share responsibility for parenting, whether
romantically involved or not,65,69 such as same-sex parents,
adoptive parents, divorced or never married parents, and mothers and maternal grandmothers.70
Consistent with a family systems perspective,8 better coparenting relationship quality is associated with children’s
positive social and emotional development over and above the effects of both
romantic relationship quality between parents (if present) and mothers’ and
fathers’ parenting.71 Notably, coparenting relationship quality among same-sex parents shows
similar associations with children’s socioemotional development.72 If supportive, coparenting relationships may help caregivers, especially
fathers, promote children’s positive socioemotional development,73 but undermining or conflictual coparenting relationships may have a
detrimental effect on child development. For instance, although grandmother
involvement may benefit children, conflict between mothers and grandmothers can
be detrimental to children’s socioemotional development.63,74 Thus,
prevention and intervention programs have been developed to support effective
relationships between coparents.75,76 For example, Feinberg’s
Family Foundations program targets couples expecting their first child and
focuses on building strong coparenting relationships across the transition to
parenthood77,78—a critical foundation for parent-child relational
health.
Coparenting research highlights the role of supportive versus undermining
coparenting for children’s development. Often, the extent to which coparents
support or undermine one another stems from whether they share the same
views on parenting goals and practices and have a similar perspective on the
child’s development. Thus, when interacting with patients, we suggest
inquiring about the extent of agreement versus disagreement among the adults
who make decisions regarding the child’s health and development. For
example, the primary custodial parent may emphasize healthy food choices and
regular physical activity, whereas the nonresidential coparent may provide
markedly different choices during visitation periods. Alternatively, one
parent may have concerns about a child’s language or motor development,
whereas a grandparent may continually emphasize that the child is “just
fine.” These discrepancies in perceptions of typical versus atypical
development may delay or interfere with prevention efforts, medical
diagnosis, and treatment. Disagreements among multiple caregivers may create
stress and tension within families, and challenges with coparenting can be
addressed through prevention and intervention programs.
Parental Characteristics That Contribute to Parenting and Relational
Health
Psychosocial Resources and Mental Health
Belsky’s early model of parenting competence suggests that multiple factors
affect parenting and child outcomes, with parents’ psychosocial resources
playing a prominent role.3 Individual differences between parents in their personality
characteristics affect the quality of their parenting.79 In particular, higher openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and
agreeableness, and lower neuroticism has been related to more optimal parenting
cognitions, practices, and behaviors, including parental warmth and support for
autonomy.79-81
For parents with common mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, the
experience of parenting may be especially challenging. Maternal depression has
been linked consistently with more negative and disengaged parenting behavior
and lower engagement in healthy feeding and sleep practices.82 Less research has considered fathers’ mental health in relation to their parenting,83 although there has been a recent increase in attention to fathers’
antenatal and postnatal depression,84 and fathers who experience postpartum depression demonstrate lower levels
of developmentally appropriate positive engagement with their infant children.83 Anxiety disorders in fathers as well as mothers have been linked with
more overinvolved parenting behavior that does not foster age-appropriate
independence in children.85
Although prevalence rates suggest the importance of considering parental anxiety
and depression, other mental health disorders should be considered as well. For
example, for mothers diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, higher
levels of negative affectivity as well as lower rates of effortful control86 and sensitivity, and support for child autonomy87 have been reported. Less maternal sensitivity has also been reported
among mothers with obsessive compulsive disorder.88
Screening for parental mental health concerns from pregnancy (or from
pregnancy planning) throughout the child’s development is consistent with a
relational health approach. Beyond screening, health care providers can
become aware of evidence-based treatments that may support healthy outcomes
in children by supporting maternal mental health and parenting skills.89 For example, the attachment-based, group intervention Mom Power,
which emphasizes parenting, self-care, and engagement in treatment, holds
promise for supporting positive outcomes for children by supporting maternal
mental health and parenting competence.90 With increased knowledge of evidence-based treatments for fathers’
mental health and parenting, we may be able to move beyond a focus on
mothers to provide all parents with a stronger support system and resource
base for effective parenting.
Parental Developmental History and Adverse Experiences in Childhood
According to Belsky’s model of the determinants of parenting, a parent’s
psychosocial resources stem from their developmental history.3 The experience of adversity and toxic stress during development may
affect brain architecture,91 a term used to convey how early experiences help build the structural
foundation for healthy brain development. Under conditions of sustained,
persistent stress such as maltreatment or neglect, the hypothalamic pituitary
adrenal axis may be affected, contributing to atypical diurnal patterns of
cortisol and increased risk over the course of development.92 As our understanding of the impact of toxic stress on children has grown,
the focus on understanding patterns of intergenerational transmission of
impaired parenting has grown as well. Experiences of adversity and toxic stress
in one generation are linked to poorer parenting and developmental outcomes in
the next generation.93 Thus, improving the quality of the caregiving environment as early as
possible may help improve stress responding in young children.92
Foundational work on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) as predictors of
physical, relational, and behavioral health has contributed to a growing
understanding of the dose-response relation between experiences of adversity in
early childhood (conceptualized as exposure to abuse and household dysfunction)
and well-being in adulthood94 as well as the experience of parenting.95 Pregnant women reporting higher levels of ACEs in early childhood, for
example, exhibit more hostile parenting toward their own infants; this pattern
of hostile parenting then increases the child’s risk for poorer developmental outcomes.96
In response to growing recognition of the impact of adversity and toxic stress
within families, in 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a
policy statement recommending education for health professionals on ACEs along
with 2-generational screening for ACEs within families.97,98 By
screening for parental and child ACEs, health providers may be able to provide
referrals to trauma-informed therapeutic supports within the community that can
help build or rebuild relational health.
Yet, in the face of adversity, the presence of individuals who are connected to
the child, such as family members, can help mitigate its negative effects.4 In addition to exploring multiple factors related to the experience of
adversity, a relational health perspective suggests the importance of
identifying and growing supportive connections. For example, the neurosequential
model of therapeutics focuses on relational health and connectedness with others.99 Results from recent work with this model highlight the importance of
promoting the health, safety, and positivity of the parent-child
relationship.
Although pediatric health care providers are aware of the impact of ACEs on
parenting and developmental outcomes, additional research, education, and
resources are necessary to support practitioners in identifying and
addressing these impacts within families.100 The limitations and potential cost-benefit analysis of screening for
ACEs must also be considered because screening without provision of adequate
referrals to evidence-based treatments may undermine the possible value of
the screen.101 Moreover, identification of appropriate screening tools for ACEs
remains an important consideration. Focusing on the experiences of adversity
as an ACE score that relates to poorer health outcomes may confuse
correlation with causation; thus, to best inform policy and practice,
factors such as timing of adversity, the overall pattern of stress, and the
absence or availability of protective factors must be considered.4 Yet through increased awareness of ACEs (both the parent’s and the
child’s) as well as other psychosocial risk factors for impaired relational
health, professionals can widen their lens of assessment when interacting
with parents and children during medical visits.
Child Characteristics That Contribute to Parenting and Parent-Child Relational
Health
Another set of key factors in the quality of parenting and parent-child relationships
involves characteristics of the child. Recognizing the bidirectional nature of
relationships between parents and children, Bornstein noted that “caregiving is a
two-way street.”102 Although early literature emphasized the parents’ impact on the child, a
relational health approach to development suggests that we consider child
contributions to parenting as well as to the overall parent-child relationship.
Among a number of child characteristics that may affect parent-child relational
health, research has focused on child temperament and age as well as children with
special health care needs.
Temperament
Although early research on temperament emphasized the child’s inborn
characteristics (eg, rhythmicity, mood) and temperament types such as easy,
difficult, and slow to warm up,103 our current understanding of temperament reflects the interplay between
biological and environmental factors over the course of an individual’s development.104 Definitions of temperament typically include individual differences in
activity, emotionality, attention, and self-regulation.104 However, particularly relevant to the experience of parenting is the
temperamental characteristic of reactivity, defined as the extent to which the
child is predisposed to experiencing strong negative and/or positive emotions,
which may reflect the sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli.105
Although difficult child temperament has long been viewed as a risk factor for
poorer parent-child relational health,106 more recent theory and research on the concept of differential
susceptibility suggest that children with difficult or highly reactive
temperaments may be more susceptible to both the negative and positive effects
of the parenting environment.105,107 For example, children
with more difficult temperaments, reflecting higher levels of reactivity, may be
particularly susceptible to the detrimental effects of negative parenting.108 In contrast, for highly reactive children, the experience of more
positive parenting is associated with fewer child behavior problems109 and greater social competence.110 Parenting intervention studies have further shown that more reactive
children appear to benefit more from experimentally induced positive changes in parenting.111 Thus, it is important for practitioners to shift their perspectives on
“difficult” children from vulnerability to opportunity and support parents in
adopting a similar view. Indeed, to the extent that the biological parents of a
highly reactive child may share similar underlying genetic sensitivities,112 these parents may be especially responsive to practitioners’ efforts,
just as their children are particularly responsive to their parenting.
Age
Because the demands and challenges of parenting change as a function of
children’s age, parents must have opportunities to gain research-informed
recommendations for supporting relational health with their children from birth
throughout the life span. For example, within early childhood, toddlers’ and
preschoolers’ growing autonomy and self-awareness creates new demands and
opportunities for both parent and child. Thus, supporting parents in reflecting
on the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs regarding their child’s increasing
autonomy could be one strategy for supporting relational health as children move
through the early childhood years. Moreover, the roles of various parenting
practices for supporting children’s self-regulatory capabilities may differ
across early childhood, with responsiveness most critical in infancy and other
forms of support becoming more critical during the preschool years.113 Research must, therefore, identify which practices are most relevant, at
which age,113 and for which outcome of interest. Doing so will help practitioners
provide targeted support to families, based on parents’ concerns regarding their
child’s particular social and emotional strengths and challenges.
Special Health Care Needs
Children with special health care needs represent a growing demographic,114 and expert recommendations continue to promote early detection in primary
care.115,116 Just as providers should consider the parent factors
contributing to relational health, the child’s contribution to parent-child
relationships is paramount. Within the family context, a child with a
developmental disability and/or special health care needs may require
disproportionate resources and time compared with neurotypical siblings.117 The child’s condition may translate into added health care costs and
increased stress for parents along with decreased access to social support and
leisure activities within the community.118,119 For example, a
systematic review of parenting stress in the face of chronic child illness
indicated that among parents who were parenting a child with chronic illness,
significantly higher levels of parenting stress were found; in turn, this stress
was related to lower levels of psychological adjustment among parents and children.120 Among parents of children with autism specture disorder (ASD), higher
levels of parenting stress and psychological distress have also been
reported.121,122 These higher levels of parental stress and distress
may, in turn, affect parental availability and sensitivity, thus affecting
relational health.
In light of the evidence on child contributions to parenting and
developmental outcomes, it seems important to consider the “what” and “how”
of child contributions to relational health. Identifying the ways in which
child characteristics influence and interact with parenting behaviors and
relational health may provide practitioners with the tools and questions
necessary to shift from a focus on the effects of parenting on children to
also consider how parenting has been influenced by the child and how the
overall health of the relationship has been shaped by both relational
partners.
Contextual and Process Variables That May Affect Relational Health
Although the bidirectional nature of parent-child relationships underscores the
importance of considering parent and child contributions to relational health, a
family systems approach, coupled with a bioecological approach, suggests that the
social and contextual contexts in which parent-child relationships are embedded
should be considered as well.
Parent-Child Feeding Practices
The promising protective role of healthy parent-child relationships in the
development of obesity123 in early childhood is also evident, perhaps via links with more optimal
self-regulation in young children.124,125 For example, theoretical models125 and research126 on the development of appetite self-regulation and positive physical
activity habits,127,128 which are critical to weight-related health throughout
the life span, highlight the important role of parenting. Parental behaviors
such as permissiveness or indulgence have been associated with weight status and
obesity in childhood. More specifically, allowing children too much freedom
regarding food choices in society’s obesogenic food environment can increase
children’s risk for obesity.123 Similarly, unrestricted, unmonitored screen time has also been associated
with unhealthy weight status.129 Yet the question remains to what extent these cycles occur within
families, whereby parents’ lack of control over their own food choices and
screen time contribute to unhealthy weight status for their children and the
unhealthy weight status of children contributes to parents’ continued struggles
with their own food choices and activity levels. Thus, a family-level relational
approach to understanding risks for obesity may be particularly
advantageous.
Given that parents’ attitudes and beliefs can shape a range of parenting
behaviors related to health and wellness, including feeding practices, exploring
relational correlates and predictors of feeding practices beginning in infancy
seems prudent. Parents’ feeding practices provide a unique window into
parent-child relationship health, because from birth, feeding makes up a
critical part of parents’ daily interactions with young children. Decisions
regarding breastfeeding and/or bottle-feeding can cause considerable stress for parents.130 And although children’s eating behavior emerges early and is relatively
stable over time, eating is influenced more by external factors across development.131
Mothers who use food to soothe their distressed infants or toddlers have reported
lower parenting self-efficacy and higher child negativity.132 Using food to soothe was also linked with higher weight status among
children, particularly for children who were perceived as having more negative temperaments.132 Among preschoolers, parents’ use of food for the purpose of emotion
regulation was associated with children’s increased intake of sweets when not
hungry, a pattern that may reflect the early origins of children’s emotional eating.133
Eating behaviors and nutrition are important components of lifestyle
medicine. In promoting healthy eating behavior and weight outcomes for
children, health care professionals can consider how parents’ attitudes may
shape their feeding practices—above and beyond a child’s weight status—and
how dyadic and family-level interactions around food may support or
undermine relational health. From birth, providers can recognize that
decisions regarding feeding (eg, breast and/or formula; homemade meals
versus fast food) may be multiply determined and best understood through a
relational health lens, where parent and child factors are viewed as
contributing to parenting practices, practices that may differ from
recommended best practices for promoting child health outcomes.
The Household Environment: Family Chaos, Technology, and Social Media
Use
The home environment represents an important context for parent-child relational
health, including the quality of parenting as well as children’s well-being and
health.134-138 Recent research, focused
on household chaos, has highlighted the role of disorder/disorganization139 and instability/turbulence140 for understanding parenting quality and family well-being. Lower levels
of household chaos (evidenced by greater organization, stability, and
predictability) are associated with higher-quality parenting behavior than home
environments characterized as noisy, crowded, unpredictable, and disorganized.138 Among preschoolers, recent evidence suggests that higher rates of
household chaos are also associated with higher screen use.141
In fact, parents’ and children’s increasing engagement with, and reliance on,
technology and social media suggest the need for providers to consider
technology and social media as interactive partners. For example, Facebook may
provide new parents with an important source of social capital,142 and parents report using the internet to gain information about pediatric
health.143,144 Yet parents (and grandparents) do not report
universally positive effects of their technology use. For example, parents may
experience a range of internal tensions surrounding their use of mobile
technology, such as cognitive, emotional, and relationship tension.145 Researchers are documenting how technology may interrupt the flow of
interaction patterns between children and their parents—a concept known as technoference.146 For example, higher levels of child internalizing and externalizing
behavior problems have been reported by mothers who also reported higher levels
of technoference in their interactions with their children.146
Supporting parents in identifying, reducing, or coping with household chaos,
as well as technoference, may be promising avenues for supporting relational
health. Because the experience of chaos in the home environment often
co-occurs with poverty139 as well as parental mental health symptoms,147 screening and intervention approaches aimed at identifying and
addressing the multiple co-occurring factors that relate to family chaos may
be warranted. Moreover, gauging the perceived impact of technology and
social media use on parent-child relational health may be an important area
of inquiry for health practitioners.
Cultural Context and Relational Health
Understanding relational health requires us to also consider the impact of race,
ethnicity, and culture on parent-child relationships; accordingly, consideration
of diversity has moved to the forefront of our current research and practice
efforts. Although broad parenting goals are remarkably similar across diverse cultures,102 the processes by which parents in varying cultural contexts seek to
achieve these goals may differ. For example, some scholars have suggested that
the concept of sensitivity, the primary determinant of secure attachment
according to attachment theorists, may be biased toward more individualistic
cultures because it is focused on meeting the child’s individual needs.148 Moreover, the meaning of parenting constructs such as controlling
behavior may vary across cultures. For example, Asian American parents may
emphasize strict control of children as part of culturally embedded approaches
to parenting, which are not equivalent to western notions of harsh/controlling
parenting and do not appear to have negative effects on their children’s
development.149,150
These debates can support practitioners in reflecting on how their own beliefs
about what is the “best” kind of parenting to promote relational health and
positive child outcomes may be shaping their messaging for parents. For example,
among immigrant families, attention to acculturation—the process of adapting to
a new culture—rather than parenting behavior, per se, may provide a window into
relational health. For example, acculturation may happen at different rates for
children and parents, and greater discrepancies in the level of acculturation
may contribute to increased parent-child conflict.151
The roles of culture, race, and ethnicity in parenting practices are particularly
apparent with respect to discipline practices. For example, higher rates of
corporal punishment, including spanking, are generally reported by African
American parents, in comparison to Hispanic or white parents,152 although recent evidence suggests similar endorsement of spanking by
African American and Hispanic mothers, along with longitudinal associations
between endorsement of spanking and children’s later internalizing and
externalizing behaviors.153 Evidence continues to highlight the negative impact of corporal
punishment on children154 and the AAP’s 2018 statement on effective discipline emphasizes the need
for positive alternatives to corporal punishment and spanking.155 And, although many parents report spanking their young children, these
same parents may also be looking for nonphysical, effective alternatives for
guiding their children’s behavior.156
Understanding how cultural beliefs and practices shape parents’ expectations
and socialization goals may help us better define what relational health is,
both within and across diverse families. Health care professionals can be a
source of guidance and support for parents to choose discipline strategies
that align with research and support parent-child relational health. When
practitioners recognize the larger context in which parents’ discipline
decisions are embedded, they may more readily identify the beliefs,
histories, and socialization goals that underlie families’ discipline
practices. Health providers can recognize parents’ concerns regarding
children’s behavior and provide culturally responsive, research-informed,
preventive recommendations for helping parents identify alternative
strategies to the use of corporal punishment and physical discipline.
Reducing Risks to Relational Health: Screening and Referral
Given that the parent-child relationship is critical for healthy development, health
providers must adopt a dyadic-level, family systemic, and culturally informed
approach to screening, referring, and treating parent-child dyads to integrate
research with practice. Equipping health professionals with knowledge of relational
health may provide a solid foundation for supporting parent-child relational health
from birth. For example, evidence from research with pediatric residents suggests
that training in a parent-child relational framework was effective in supporting
residents’ observational skills and knowledge of child development.157
An emphasis on transactional associations within families further underscores the
importance of screening and early intervention to support child and parental
well-being and use of positive parenting practices.10 Commonly used assessments in parent-child attachment research, such as the
Strange Situation Procedure158 Attachment Q-Set,159 are labor-intensive and were not developed as clinically relevant screening
tools. Moreover, even when insecurity in the parent-child relationship is suspected,
access to attachment-based interventions (ie, VIPP-SD, ABC) may be extremely
limited.
Whereas much of the research literature on early parent-child relationships
(typically mother-child relationships) has focused on attachment, recent work
highlights the dyadic-level construct of emotional connection for
understanding early parent-child relational health. The development of the Welch
Emotional Connection Screen (WECS)160 reflects an effort to provide practitioners with a rapid and valid screening
tool for parent-child relational health from birth to 5 years. The WECS considers
the presence or absence of 4 mutual behaviors that may serve to promote and maintain
emotional connection within a parent-child dyad: attraction, facial responsiveness,
vocal responsiveness, and sensitivity/reciprocity. Based on the overall interaction,
a score of EC+ (connected) or EC− (not connected) is assigned to the dyad.
The WECS developed out of work with the Family Nurture Intervention, which seeks to
support the development of emotional connection and coregulation via the provision
of calming sessions that focus on the sensory experiences of touch, vocal soothing,
and skin-to-skin contact.161-163 Results from
an RCT study indicated that mothers and infants participating in the Family Nurture
Intervention showed improvements in face-to-face dyadic interaction, including
increased frequency and quality of mothers’ touch and for boys, infant’s vocal
affect and gaze.164
Emotional connection, as assessed by the WECS in infancy, has been associated with
healthier autonomic responding among infants born prematurely165 as well as with fewer internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in a
full-term, longitudinal sample.166 Thus, emerging evidence suggests that the WECS holds promise for screening,
anticipatory guidance, and referral of early parent-child relationships that may
benefit from support and intervention to promote healthy regulatory functioning and
decrease risk for later child behavior problems. Efforts are under way to train a
range of professionals—from pediatric residents to infant mental health
practitioners and home visitors—to be reliable raters of parent-child relational
health using the WECS.
In families with elevated risk for maltreatment, the automated self-report survey,
the CARTS (Computerized Childhood Attachment and Relational Trauma Screen), reflects
a relational approach to the assessment of trauma in childhood.167,168 The CARTS
considers what trauma occurred and assesses caregivers’ emotional availability,
along with responses to the reported maltreatment. In contrast, the SEEK program
(Safe Environment for Every Kid) focuses on risk factors related to child
maltreatment, including parental depression, stress, and substance abuse.168,169 Thus, the
SEEK program may benefit pediatric primary care professionals through its focus on
psychosocial stress within families, which if addressed early, may prevent child
maltreatment.
Notably, SEEK embodies a relational health perspective by acknowledging the parent’s
love for the child as a pathway to healthy outcomes for both parent and child as
well as by acknowledging the relationships between health professionals and parents
as protective factors for parents and children.169,170 For example, part of the
SEEK program is the SEEK Parent Questionnaire, which begins by empathetically
validating the sometimes challenging everyday experience of being a parent while
simultaneously offering support to parents dealing with concerning circumstances.
SEEK also aims to support relational health through the REAP approach, which
encourages health care providers to Reflect-Empathize-Assess-and Plan with
parents.
Intervention approaches that incorporate mindfulness practices, such as the 9-week
Mindful Parenting course tested in the Netherlands, also hold promise for supporting
relational health within families. Mindful Parenting aims to increase awareness,
decrease parental stress, and improve coparenting.171 Both parents participating in the program and their children report
reductions in internalizing/externalizing symptomology. The interpersonal focus of
mindfulness-based interventions supports healthy parent-child relationships through
increased awareness of parent-child interactions as well as positive changes in both
child and parent functioning.172
Summary and Conclusions
Beyond attachment theory, which emphasizes parental sensitivity and responsivity as a
primary determinant of attachment security, a relational health science approach
offers a wider lens for understanding how parent-child relationships may affect
children’s development. A relational health approach recognizes both partners’
contributions to the establishment and maintenance of relational processes and
highlights the potential value of the health care provider as a relational partner
for parents and children. Our focus here was on socioemotional development; future
work will consider how a relational health framework can be applied to a range of
parent-child health decisions from vaccinations and sleep behaviors, to physical
activity, and medication use.
Although we view primary care as a valuable context for supporting relational health,
continued development and validation of screening tools for relational health that
are suitable for clinical and applied contexts remain an important goal along with
more widespread availability of effective interventions. Moreover, given the
existing demands on health care providers, we recognize that a relational health
perspective on development may create additional demands on providers. Perhaps a
necessary first step is a shift in perspective, more than a shift in practice. By
viewing the parent-child relationship as part of the “patient” and, therefore, part
of health promotion, the long-term gains may be worth the initial investment.
By networking with community resources, health care providers can build a pipeline of
referrals for parents as a component of pediatric and primary care. Offering
parent-friendly pamphlets, information sheets, and face-to-face communication that
reflects a relational health view on development may help parents see themselves as
partners in relational health, rather than as the cause of their child’s mental
health, behavioral, or developmental problems. Such negative attributions may
contribute to feelings of shame and guilt—feelings that may undermine parenting
self-efficacy and parents’ engagement in children’s wellness and treatment. The
AAP’s recent call for pediatricians to partner with parents in supporting healthy
outcomes through the sharing of information regarding child development and parenting155 reflects the promise of a relational health approach.
Returning to the opening quote from Bowlby, we suggest that health care providers are
in a strong position to serve children by valuing their parents and viewing child
development through the lens of relational health. Perhaps by uncovering who
that person is—the one who is “irrationally crazy” about the
child, as Bronfenbrenner advised—professionals can help cultivate and reinforce that
connection. And in its absence, we can seek to identify ways to build a web of
relational health for the child and for the parent, a web that can support each
partner in service to the relationship.
