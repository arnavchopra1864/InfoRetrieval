Fourier Transform
Fourier Transform is a mathematical model which helps to transform the signals between two different domains, such as transforming signal from frequency domain to time domain or vice versa. Fourier transform has many applications in Engineering and Physics, such as signal processing, RADAR, and so on. In this article, we are going to discuss the formula of Fourier transform, properties, tables, Fourier cosine transform, Fourier sine transform with complete explanations.
What is Fourier Transform?
The generalisation of the complex Fourier series is known as the Fourier transform. The term “Fourier transform” can be used in the mathematical function, and it is also used in the representation of the frequency domain. The Fourier transform helps to extend the Fourier series to the non-periodic functions, which helps us to view any functions in terms of the sum of simple sinusoids.
Fourier Transform Formula
As discussed above, the Fourier transform is considered to be a generalisation of the complex Fourier series in the limit L→∞. Also, convert discrete An to the continuous F(k)dk and let n/L→k. Finally, convert the sum to an integral.
Thus, the Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:
Forward and Inverse Fourier Transform
From the Fourier transform formula, we can derive the forward and inverse Fourier transform.
Fourier Transform Properties
The following are the important properties of Fourier transform:
Fourier Transform in Two Dimensions

Applications of Fourier Transform
Fourier transform is used in a wide range of applications, such as:
Fourier Sine Transform
The Fourier sine transform is defined as the imaginary part of full complex Fourier transform, and it is given by:
Fourier Cosine Transform
The Fourier transform for cosines of a real function is defined as the real part of a full complex Fourier transform.
Frequently Asked Questions on Fourier Transform
Is Fourier transform a generalised form of the Fourier series?
Yes, Fourier transform is the generalised form of a complex Fourier series.
Why do we use Fourier transform?
Fourier transform is one of the important concepts used in image processing, which helps to decompose the image into the sine and cosine components.
Give one comparison between the Laplace transform and the Fourier transform.
The Laplace transform is used to analyse the unstable system, and has a convergence factor. Whereas, the Fourier transform cannot be used to analyse the unstable systems, and it does not have any convergence factor.
What are the properties of Fourier transform?
The properties of Fourier transform are:
Linearity property
Frequency shifting property
Time reversal property
Time-shifting property, and so on.
Is the Fourier transform linear?
Yes, the Fourier transform is linear.
What is the use of Fourier transform?
The Fourier transform is used in the transition of signal from the time spectrum to the frequency spectrum.
